# Livery fullweb cutover and the servo-* retirement

**Date:** 2026-07-24
**Status:** in execution, current-state correction 2026-08-15. D0 is ruled
(lane, at the revised price; multicol knocked out). Every stage F0-F6 carries
its detail, instrument, and receipt. Product reachability completed as an
earlier projection gate rather than part of the final F4 flip; see the
[Livery product route and document resources plan](2026-08-08_livery_product_route_and_document_resources_execution_plan.md).

**Current truth.** Product-route R0-R4 and R5a-R5d are landed. Pelt exposes
explicit `livery` and `livery-scripted` routes over the shared document-resource
boundary, including linked CSS, image and font replacement, and Livery's
supported CSS rule-object projection. The incumbent `viewer` and scripted
routes remain the defaults. The F4 scripted implementation boundary is
complete, but the default flip is still gated by its parity receipts. Buckram
K4 is closed at `610df0981a8`; K5 is active on `buckram-k5-positioning`, and
K6 is planned but blocked on K5h closure. The recorded F0/F3 figures below
remain the latest full cutover ledger, not a fresh 2026-08-15 rerun.

**Where the two lanes stand.**

| lane | measure | 2026-07-24 | now |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| testharness (F3) | subtests vs Stylo | +3,499 | **+3,555** |
| reftest (F3b) | files vs Stylo | -241 | **-149** |
| reftest (F3b) | **S-only, the F4 bar** | **1,055** | **916** |
| F0 | consumed longhands missing | 38 | **35** |

S-only is the count of files Stylo renders and Livery does not, which is the
F4 regression count and the only reftest number the flip depends on. Net
deltas are reported because they are asked for, not because they gate
anything; css-tables is the standing counter-example, where the file count
fell by 3 in the same change that cut S-only by 6. Excluding css-multicol
per the D0 knockout, the F4 bar is **901 files**.

**What has been taken, and what it taught.** Four slices have landed, and in
three of them the plan's own diagnosis was wrong in a way worth recording:

- **The color subsystem (F0).** css-color went -451 to **+3091**, the
  largest single swing in the ledger, in two steps: the CSS Color 4/5
  function grammar, then a specified-value layer for the forms CSSOM must
  serialize as authored. Three unimplemented functions remain (196
  subtests).
- **css/selectors (F3).** The last unmeasured directory, and the falsifier
  read clean: +56 over 5,376 subtests, one regressing file. Matching is
  genuinely shared, so the directory leaves the ledger permanently.
- **Grid abspos.** Predicted as a layout gap; it was **grammar**. The
  placement and alignment shorthands were unimplemented, so placements never
  reached taffy. Behind it sat an engine bug (whitespace generating
  anonymous boxes) worth more than the slice itself.
- **Tables, historical 2026-07-26 diagnosis.** Predicted as
  `table-layout: fixed`; neither lane implemented it at that point. The
  incumbent won by laying tables out as a grid, which the first Livery parity
  slice also did. Buckram has since replaced that diagnosis with
  standards-owned table models and algorithms through K4f.

**The method that produced those corrections is the transferable part.**
Measure the whole affected set before believing a slice, because two of
today's changes looked like wins on their target directory and were net
losses across the corpus; the blank-run rule was committed in that state and
had to be corrected. Prefer a bisect to a hypothesis: reverting one hunk
attributed a 128-file CSS2 regression precisely and cleared three other
changes of suspicion in one run.

**Ruling closed 2026-07-26, implementation closed 2026-08-10:** Buckram owns
table layout. The parity emulation was a useful falsifier and has been deleted.
K4 closed at `610df0981a8` with table sizing, fragments, captions, separated
and collapsed borders, positioned parts, and compatibility-bridge deletion.

**Open, in measured value order:** the `content` longhand (F0 ratchet plus
19 CSS2 files, one slice paid twice), contextual color computation
(`currentcolor`, system colors, element `color-scheme`, and paint), `order`
with grid auto-placement, and the css-flexbox long tail, which is measured
as genuinely flat and stays ranked last. Everything after F4 is gated on
receipts, not dates.

**A standing correction to how this plan reasons.** Several entries were
written as "the incumbent does X, so X is on-target". That is a valid
argument about the F4 bar, which is defined against Stylo, and an invalid
one about the engine, which is defined against the specifications. Where
the two diverge the specification wins and the gap is recorded, never
emulated quietly.

**The deeper defect, named by Mark 2026-07-26.** Livery was designed as a
bounded Cambium engine, and this plan has been promoting it to fullweb by
adding property names and improving differential counts without replacing
its bounded semantic models. Where the model cannot represent a CSS
semantic, Genet collapses it onto the nearest Taffy or host primitive:
tables become grid, rows become flex, most display values become block,
`fixed` becomes absolute, `sticky` becomes relative, intrinsic sizes become
auto. CSS defines those as distinct box roles, formatting contexts, and
intrinsic sizes, not interchangeable backend modes. Every "the premise was
wrong" finding in this plan is a symptom of that one defect. The structural
answer is a standards-owned layout engine with a box tree and fragment tree;
see the
[Buckram plan](./2026-07-26_buckram_css_layout_engine_plan.md). The earlier
[box-tree plan](./2026-07-26_livery_box_tree_and_formatting_contexts_plan.md)
is preserved for its completed B-1/B0 receipt.
Deferrals are tracked in the register below, and the two ledgers are split
in the section above.

**Decision record:** Mark, 2026-07-24: "no more servo-*. we grow our own
equivalents and obviate servo-* crates, or delete 'em," with the teardown
explicitly sequenced **after Livery replaces Stylo**. This plan defines that
cutover, the stage the
[harvest plan](./2026-07-20_stylo_harvest_into_livery_plan.md) names only as
its retirement trigger, superseded 2026-08-16 by a dogfooding gate (see
the revision at the end of this plan) ("Livery takes the fullweb default with WPT parity
receipts"), and the teardown that rides behind it.
**Companions:** the harvest plan (H0-H6, receipts live there), the
[consumed-property audit](./2026-07-13_genet_consumed_css_property_audit.md)
(the 126-longhand bar), the
[profile ladder plan](./2026-05-12_genet_profile_ladder_plan.md), the
[Livery product route and document resources plan](2026-08-08_livery_product_route_and_document_resources_execution_plan.md),
and the [HTML presentational-hints plan](2026-08-08_livery_html_presentational_hints_execution_plan.md).

## D0. The cutover shape: lane, not re-seam (recommendation)

Two shapes could satisfy the trigger. Re-seam keeps genet-layout's box tree
and swaps its style input from Stylo structs to Livery computed values. Lane
grows genet-livery's retained document (Livery styles, taffy geometry, its
own linebox, paint) to fullweb fidelity and flips the default to it.

**Recommendation: lane.** Evidence, verified 2026-07-24:

- genet-livery's layout dependency is Taffy 0.12.1 with `float_layout`
  enabled, redirected through `support/patches/taffy`. The earlier claim that
  it used crates.io directly was stale. Buckram is the standalone,
  standards-owned layout crate; its Taffy adapter uses the low-level algorithm
  API rather than `TaffyTree`.
- Every WPT receipt and every pinned `--renderer livery` baseline accrues on
  the lane. A re-seamed genet-layout would start its receipt history from
  zero.
- Re-seam defeats the retirement goal: genet-layout has 12 in-repo consumers
  and anchors most of the servo-* fan-in (servo-base 19 dependents,
  servo-malloc-size-of 27, servo-url 11, largely through the fullweb cone).
  Keeping its box tree keeps that cone alive.
- Both lanes are taffy-centered already; re-seam buys a second box tree that
  F5 would then delete.

**Fallback, bounded:** if the lane hits a fidelity wall on a named subsystem
(tables and replaced-element intrinsic sizing are the candidates), the answer
is lifting that subsystem from genet-layout into the lane under the harvest
plan's fork-and-own rules, never re-seaming Stylo back in.

**CONFIRMED by Mark, 2026-07-24**: "i'm ok with lane... big blast radius, big
impact. proceed." The apprehension is the right instinct and the sequencing
answers it: F3's ledger measures the radius before F4 flips anything, and
nothing is deleted until F5/F6, after the receipts exist.

**Cost basis revised the same day by F3b.** The lane ruling was taken partly
on the F3 testharness reading (Livery ahead everywhere, nothing structural
left). The reftest lane does not support that: Livery trails by 241 files and
**1,055 files would regress** if the default flipped today. The direction
still holds: re-seam would keep genet-layout, which *is* the Servo layout
cone the "no more servo-*" ruling exists to remove, so re-seaming buys layout
fidelity by preserving exactly what F5/F6 are meant to delete. What changed is
price: the lane owes real layout and paint work (flexbox and grid fidelity,
background paint, multicol from nothing) before F4, not just grammar slices.
Mark should see the F3b table before more is spent either way; if the answer
is that the price is too high, the fallback is the one already named (lift
the failing subsystems out of genet-layout into the lane), not a re-seam.

**RULED by Mark, 2026-07-25: lane, at the revised price.** The F3b table was
reviewed; the direction holds and the grind is accepted. Two riders:

- **Multicol is knocked out rather than built.** `column-count`,
  `column-width`, and `column-span` stay `[[unimplemented]]`, the
  css-multicol reftest directory leaves the F4 parity bar, and the
  capability returns as its own planned build after F5, a recorded
  knockout per the established practice, never a silent gap. It was the
  only structural item in either ledger; with it out, every remaining F3b
  cluster is fidelity work.
- **The genet-layout lift fallback stays in reserve.** WITHDRAWN
  2026-08-16, see the revision at the end of this plan; a frozen fork is
  not a viable quarry, and any needed Stylo behaviour comes from upstream.
  The original reasoning is kept below for the record. It is invoked per
  subsystem only if the flexbox/grid fidelity pass shows taffy integration
  cannot close the 386; nothing is lifted preemptively.

## Stages, each with a receipt

- **F0 - consumed-set parity.** Close the 38 consumed longhands Livery does
  not yet implement (diffed 2026-07-24 against the audit's 126-longhand
  union; all 38 are already `[[unimplemented]]` catalog entries). These are
  ordinary H5 slices; F0 is the tracking bundle.

  **Verified state, 2026-07-25** (re-diffed the audit's overlap table against
  `components/livery/properties.toml`): 126 consumed, 88 implemented, **38
  missing, all 38 present as `[[unimplemented]]` entries**, none absent from
  the catalog. The headline holds exactly. The five lift units regroup, with
  the same total:

  | unit | count | longhands |
  |---|---:|---|
  | animation/transition controls | 7 | `animation-delay`, `animation-direction`, `animation-fill-mode`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-play-state`, `transition-behavior`, `transition-timing-function` |
  | background family | 6 | `background-attachment`, `background-clip`, `background-origin`, `background-position-x`, `background-position-y`, `background-size` |
  | border-image | 5 | `border-image-outset`, `border-image-repeat`, `border-image-slice`, `border-image-source`, `border-image-width` |
  | grid and alignment stragglers | 6 | `align-self`, `justify-items`, `justify-self` (**landed 2026-07-26**, ratchet 38 to 35), `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-rows`, `grid-template-areas` |
  | layout/paint/effects singles | 14 | `clear`, `clip-path`, `contain`, `content`, `direction`, `filter`, `image-rendering`, `list-style-position`, `mix-blend-mode`, `object-fit`, `perspective`, `text-overflow`, `translate`, `will-change` |

  The earlier 8/13 split for the first and last units was off by one in each
  direction; the fifth unit is layout as much as paint (`clear`, `direction`,
  and `list-style-position` are not effects), so it is renamed rather than
  re-sorted.

  **The multicol knockout does not touch F0.** `column-count`,
  `column-width`, and `column-span` are absent from the 126-longhand consumed
  set, so the 2026-07-25 knockout and F0's 126/126 receipt do not collide.
  Nothing in F0 changes because of it.

  **F0's instrument LANDED 2026-07-25.** It was missing:
  `components/livery/PROPERTY_SPACE.md` censused the whole servo-lane
  property space (implemented 95 longhands + 17 shorthands, remaining 162 +
  49), not the consumed-126 intersection, so it could not report "126/126".
  What landed:

  - `components/livery/consumed_longhands.toml`, the audit's overlap table as
    checked-in data (126 names, each tagged with the surfaces that read it).
  - `components/livery/tests/consumed_set.rs`, which asserts the intersection
    as a **ratchet** (`MAX_REMAINING`, 38 today, lower-only) and prints the
    remaining worklist with each name's catalog group on every run. A
    permanently red test would be noise and would block the workspace-green
    rule the later receipts depend on; a ratchet is green now and cannot
    silently regress. A consumed name in neither catalog table fails
    unconditionally at any ratchet value, because the census cannot count it.
  - A consumed-set section in the `import-stylo-db` census, the readable half.
  - A guard asserting the multicol knockout does not touch the consumed set,
    so the D0 ruling fails loudly if a consumer ever starts reading
    `column-*`.

  **The receipt deliberately does not live only in the generator.**
  `import-stylo-db` needs a stylo fork checkout to run at all, and the fork
  archives at F5. A receipt that needed it would die with its subject. The
  test reads two checked-in files and nothing else.

  Verified by re-running the generator against the fork at
  `b157d925267fdd37b03f43e3387ab2f0909e57b0`: **126 consumed, 88 implemented,
  38 remaining**, and the regeneration produced no catalog churn.

  Receipt: the ratchet reaches 0 and is replaced by a plain equality
  assertion; each family lands with its WPT directory delta pinned as a
  `--renderer livery` baseline.

  **First slice, per the F3 ledger: the color subsystem.** It is the single
  biggest lever in the ledger (~1,230 subtests across css-color, CSS2
  colors-007, and the `getComputedStyle-resolved-colors` tail) and it is
  cleanly bounded. Livery today parses **only `rgb()`/`rgba()`** plus hex,
  named, `transparent`, `currentcolor`, `CanvasText`. Absent: `hsl()`,
  `hwb()`, `lab()`/`lch()`, `oklab()`/`oklch()`, `color()`, `color-mix()`,
  relative color syntax, `contrast-color()`, `color-layers()`.
  cssparser 0.37 does **not** supply this: its `color.rs` is 352 lines of
  primitives (`parse_hash_color`, `parse_named_color`,
  `PredefinedColorSpace`, alpha serialization) and the function grammar is
  the consumer's job, which is why the fork implements its own. Quarry
  sizing at the fork checkout: `style/color/` (color_function 569,
  convert 936, component 189, gamut + raytrace ~261, mix) plus
  `values/specified/color.rs` 1262 and the generics/computed/animated trio
  (~554), roughly 3.5-4k lines, the same order as the `calc.rs` lift H5
  already did, and harvestable under the same fork-and-own rules with
  provenance headers. Colour conversion and gamut mapping are exactly the
  "stable and spec-hardened" material the harvest plan says to lift rather
  than reinvent.

  **LANDED 2026-07-25.** `src/values/color.rs` (197 lines, a four-variant
  enum over `u8` channels) became `src/values/color/`: `mod.rs` (the `Color`
  type, serialization, interpolation), `space.rs` (fourteen color spaces and
  the conversions between them), `parse.rs` (the function grammar), `mix.rs`
  (`color-mix()` and hue interpolation). Conversion math, mixing rules, and
  the matrices are lifted from the fork's `style/color/` under the harvest
  plan's fork-and-own rules, with per-module provenance headers naming the
  rev. Two departures from the donor: no `euclid` (matrices are written in
  the spec's own row-major order and multiplied directly, so they diff
  against the spec text without transposing), and every public accessor
  resolves missing components, so NaN never escapes the module.

  Now implemented: `hsl()`/`hsla()`, `hwb()`, `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`,
  `oklch()`, `color()` over all eight predefined spaces, `color-mix()` with
  all four hue-interpolation methods, **relative color syntax**, `none`
  components, slash alpha, angle units on hue, `calc()` in channel position,
  and CSS Color 4 clamping. The model carries float channels in the authored
  space, so a wide-gamut color survives until something asks for sRGB.

  **Relative color syntax** (`rgb(from red r g b)`, CSS Color 5) landed the
  same day in `relative.rs`. The origin converts into the output function's
  space and its channels bind to that function's keywords (`r g b`,
  `h s l`, `h w b`, `l a b`, `l c h`, `x y z`, plus `alpha`), which the
  channel grammar accepts directly and which are substituted into any
  `calc()` before it reaches the math program. Two details worth recording:
  the keywords are numbers in the *function's* units, so `rgb(from ...)`
  binds 0-255 while `color(from ... srgb ...)` binds 0-1 for the same color;
  and an omitted alpha inherits the origin's rather than resetting to 1.
  The eager `Color` leaf still rejects a `currentcolor` origin. That avoids
  a false black result but is not conforming cascade behavior; the
  authoritative computed-expression correction is specified in
  `2026-07-28_livery_contextual_color_computation_plan.md`.

  It also exposed a general bug: a hue channel only accepted angle-typed
  math, so `hsl(calc(60 + 60) 100% 50%)` failed. A hue takes both an angle
  and a bare number of degrees; both now parse.

  **RECEIPT, measured 2026-07-25, twice.** `css/css-color` on both
  renderers; data at `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-07-25_color_v2/`
  (after the function grammar) and `_v4/` (after the specified-value layer):

  | | 2026-07-24 | after grammar | after specified layer |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | Stylo subtests | 1107 | 1107 | 1107 (control) |
  | Livery subtests | 656 | 2678 | **4198** |
  | css-color delta | **-451** | +1571 | **+3091** |

  **+3,542 subtests in the day, zero regressions at every step**, and the
  directory the F3 ledger named as Livery's single worst (-451, the largest
  net-negative anywhere) now leads by 3,091. Stylo's total is identical
  across all three runs, so the comparison is sound rather than an
  environment artifact.

  **The specified-value layer (the second jump, +1,520).** CSSOM's
  `getPropertyValue()` returns the *specified* value, which keeps more of
  the authored shape than the computed value does: keywords stay keywords
  (`red`, `rebeccapurple`, `canvastext`), and `color-mix()` and relative
  colors serialize as themselves with only their arguments canonicalized
  (csswg-drafts #7302). Livery resolved absolute forms at parse time.
  `SpecifiedColor`
  (`components/livery/src/values/color/specified.rs`) is the retained layer
  in between: validation stays the resolving parser's job (nothing it
  rejects becomes a specified value), and the capture only remembers what
  the resolver forgets. It hooks in at exactly one seam,
  `canonicalize_specified_longhand`, keyed on the property catalog's value
  type; the cascade, computed values, and paint are untouched. This is a
  CSSOM boundary, not yet the standards-required computed-value boundary for
  contextual functions. The same
  boundary now carries opacity's authored range (`opacity: 3` is valid,
  serializes as `3` specified, clamps computed). One regression appeared
  mid-course and was caught by the third run: the first opacity fix
  unclamped the computed level too (`opacity-computed.html` 8 to 4); moving
  the clamp back to parse and reconstructing the raw form only at the
  specified boundary restored it.

  The run also caught a real defect the unit tests missed: the legacy comma
  forms are **type-uniform**, so `rgb(10%, 20, 30%)` and
  `rgba(-2, 300, 400%, -0.5)` are invalid for mixing percentages with
  numbers even though every channel would clamp into range alone. Livery
  accepted both, before and after the slice. Fixed, with the rule extended
  to `hsl()`/`hwb()` (number-or-angle hue, both remaining channels
  percentages), and `color-invalid.html` went 8/10 to all-pass.

  **2026-07-28 correction.** `color-layers()`, `alpha()`, and
  `contrast-color()` now have absolute-color parsers, algorithms, and
  retained specified forms. `color-mix()` follows the current one-or-more
  grammar and ordered mixing algorithm, including all-zero transparent black
  and percentage-typed math. The remaining `currentcolor` and system-color
  failures are not three parser tails. They expose the missing computed
  expression, element scheme, and used-value context. That work is separated
  into `2026-07-28_livery_contextual_color_computation_plan.md`.

  **Unit receipts, updated 2026-07-28:** 55 tests in
  `components/livery/tests/color.rs`; `cargo test -p livery --offline` is
  160 green. The 2026-07-25 cross-crate receipt remains 234 green, with
  genet-wpt, genet-documents, and genet-scripted building on the Livery
  feature.

  **Three defects surfaced, all pre-existing:**

  1. `linear-gradient()` split its stops with `str::split(',')`, so any
     comma-form color inside a gradient failed to parse
     (`linear-gradient(rgb(255, 0, 0), blue)`). Fixed with a paren-aware
     splitter. It was invisible while colors serialized as hex.
  2. `rgb(300, 0, 0)` was rejected. CSS Color 4 clamps out-of-range channels
     rather than invalidating them, so it is valid and means `rgb(255, 0, 0)`.
     The old range check was wrong and a test asserted the wrong behavior.
  3. Colors serialized as `#rrggbb`. CSS Color 4 resolves the whole sRGB
     family to `rgb()`/`rgba()`, which is what `getComputedStyle` returns.
     Corrected, along with system colors now serializing lowercase
     (`canvastext`). This moved expectations in livery and genet-livery
     tests; every change was to the spec-correct value, none to accommodate
     the implementation.

  **Named gaps, not silently approximated:** contextual color computation
  (the linked corrective plan), gamut mapping (`to_srgb8` clips per channel
  rather than doing CSS Color 4's oklch chroma reduction), and unresolved
  tree-dependent color math. Percentage-typed `calc()`, `min()`, `max()`,
  and `clamp()` now resolve against explicit color-channel or mix-weight
  bases. Gamut
  mapping is the one with teeth: clipping is visibly wrong for a saturated
  wide-gamut color, and it is a paint-quality issue rather than a parse
  failure, so it will not show up as a test error.

  The module is split under the repo's size ceiling: `mod.rs` 442,
  `parse.rs` 526, `space/mod.rs` 302, `space/rgb.rs` 251, `mix.rs` 246,
  `relative.rs` 136, `space/perceptual.rs` 113.
- **F1 - animation and transition machinery.** The harvest plan's named H2
  follow-on: the fork's transition state machine (interrupted-transition
  reversing, per-element multi-transition maps) plus animation-* behavior,
  lifted onto the generated dispatch. This retires "animation cadence rides
  the retained Stylo session." Receipt: css-transitions and css-animations
  subsets runnable and pinned on the Livery route; where a Stylo-lane pin
  exists, Livery meets or names the gap.
- **F2 - geometry and hit testing on the lane.** Livery fragments answer
  elementFromPoint and pointer targeting; scroll and client geometry
  (cssom-view's read surface) come from the lane's layout; genet-scripted
  drops its retained Stylo session for geometry. This is the moment scripted
  WPT runs pure Livery. Receipt: the cssom-view and hit-testing subsets
  pinned on Livery; the Stylo session in genet-scripted is behind an
  opt-back-in flag with nothing on by default requiring it.

  **Verified state, 2026-07-25: the retained Stylo session is unconditional
  today, and that is the exact line F2 removes.** In
  `ports/genet-wpt/src/harness.rs`, the scripted session's constructor builds
  `IncrementalLayout::new(...)` (genet-layout, so Stylo) before it branches on
  `StyleRoute`, and only the `getComputedStyle` handler is routed: the Stylo
  arm installs `WptComputedStyle` over that layout, the Livery arm installs
  `LiveryCssom` beside it. So `--renderer livery` on the scripted lane means
  "Livery answers CSSOM, Stylo still owns geometry", which is why F2 is a
  separate stage rather than a consequence of F1. The `animating()` and
  drive-loop calls just below read the same `IncrementalLayout`, so F1's
  animation cadence hangs off that object too; F1 and F2 are cutting the same
  retained session at two seams, and F2 is the one that lets it go.
- **F3 - the fullweb fidelity ledger. First pass RUN 2026-07-24 (testharness
  lane).** Both renderers over the same 27 `css/` directories, Boa,
  `--write-expectations` diffed per file. Reproduce with
  `docs/tools/ledger_run.sh` + `ledger_diff.py`.

  **Headline: Livery leads the testharness lane by +3,499 subtests**
  (11,492 vs 7,993), ahead in 21 of 27 directories, and runs about 2.4x
  faster on the same corpus. The layout directories predicted to be Stylo
  strongholds are Livery wins: sizing +471, grid +334, align +280, position
  +253, flexbox +237, writing-modes +48, CSS2 +55.

  **The caveat that bounds this result, stated first because it is the
  honest scope limit:** this is the *testharness* lane only. It measures
  parsing, computed values, and CSSOM. It does **not** measure layout and
  paint fidelity, which live in reftests (`genet-wpt reftest`, needs a GPU
  and was not run here). The directories that scored identically under both
  renderers are the tell: css-multicol skips 617 of 708 files, css-tables
  195 of 328, css-borders and cssom-view likewise flat. Identical scores
  there mean *not measured*, not parity. **A reftest pass over the same
  directories is required before F4 can claim parity**, and it is the one
  place where the "Livery is ahead" reading could still invert.

  Net-negative directories (the real slices): css-color -451, css-images
  -207, css-pseudo -35, cssom -34, css-cascade -5.

  Named clusters, grouped by cause rather than by directory:
  1. **Modern color syntax** (~1,230 subtests, the largest by far):
     relative color 583->12, `color-mix()` 230->1, `color-layers()` 160->0,
     `color()` 81->0, `contrast-color()` 16->0, alpha parsing 20->0, plus
     most of CSS2 `syntax/colors-007.html` 288->141. Livery's hex and named
     parsing are already complete and correct (it uses the same shared
     `cssparser` entry points Stylo does); the gap is entirely CSS Color
     4/5 function grammar.
  2. **Gradients** (~600): `gradient-interpolation-method` 585->0,
     gradient-position 14->0, conic-gradient calc angles.
  3. **CSS Values 5 advanced** (~220): `attr()` typed forms,
     `if-conditionals` 19->0, `random()`, minmax angle serialization.
  4. **Property-grammar breadth**, the recurring `parsing/*-valid.html`
     family across align, backgrounds, box, text, position, transitions,
     transforms, fonts, flexbox, sizing (~200 total, each file small).
     This is the same surface F0 addresses; expect F0 to close much of it.
  5. **Grid template grammar** (~160): subgrid 38->0, `repeat()` intrinsic
     21->0 (x2), template serialization.
  6. **Variables in animations** (~68) and **CSSOM serialization breadth**
     (~52, mostly `serialize-values.html` 529->497).
  7. **Pseudo-elements** (~35): replaced-element pseudos, highlight cascade.
  8. **Cascade `revert`/`revert-layer`** (~7), small and self-contained.

  Every cluster is grammar, serialization, or function coverage. None is
  structural: nothing in this pass says the lane's architecture cannot host
  fullweb. That is the finding that makes the lane ruling safe on the
  measured surface, and exactly what the reftest pass must confirm on the
  unmeasured one.

  Done when no directory remains where the Stylo lane's pinned baseline
  beats the Livery lane's, **on both the testharness and reftest lanes**.

  **`css/selectors`: RUN 2026-07-25/26, and the falsifier reads clean.**
  The original pass could not measure it (both renderers exceeded a
  30-minute budget); run unbudgeted it costs about 2h40m per renderer, which
  is why it was the last hole. Prediction: near-parity, because the harvest
  plan keeps `selectors` a shared dependency lifted nowhere, so both lanes
  run the same matching engine and any delta is integration, not matching.

  Measured (data at `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-07-25_selectors/`):

  | | stylo | livery | delta |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | subtests | 2145 | 2201 | **+56** |
  | files worse than the other | 1 (4 subtests) | 18 (60 subtests) | |

  A one-percent delta with **one** regressing file (`placeholder-shown.html`,
  a form-control pseudo-class, 4 subtests) confirms the shared-dependency
  reading; Livery's small lead is invalidation integration
  (`invalidation/*` accounts for most of the 60). Both renderers also took
  near-identical wall time (2h40m vs 2h43m), which is what shared-engine
  dominance looks like. **Per the falsifier rule, the directory leaves the
  ledger permanently.** Folding it in moves the F3 headline from +3,499 to
  **+3,555**, ahead in 22 of 28 measured directories. No instrument in F3
  remains open.

- **F3b - the reftest lane. RUN 2026-07-24. THE RESULT INVERTS F3.**
  Nine layout-heavy directories, both renderers, `genet-wpt reftest`.

  **Re-measured 2026-07-26** after the color, grid-grammar, and blank-run
  work (livery only; Stylo is untouched, so its column stands). Data at
  `wpt-ledger/2026-07-26_scoped/`:

  | directory | stylo | livery | delta | S-only |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | css-flexbox | 469 | 350 | -119 | 189 |
  | css-backgrounds | 321 | 219 | -102 | 126 |
  | css-grid | 470 | 434 | -36 | 114 |

  | css-borders | 25 | 28 | +3 | 6 |
  | CSS2 | 4149 | 4264 | +115 | 449 |
  | **TOTAL** | **5893** | **5726** | **-167** | **971** |

  **S-only, the measure that matters, goes 1055 to 971**, and the net delta
  goes -241 to -167. Almost all of it is css-grid, which is the only
  directory that has had a slice taken at it; the rest moved by single
  digits or not at all. Excluding css-multicol per the D0 knockout, the F4
  bar is **956 files**, down from 1,040.

  The 2026-07-24 table above is the as-run original and stays unedited.
  **After the 2026-07-25 multicol knockout, the F4 bar reads over the other
  eight
  directories: 5,787 Stylo, 5,550 Livery, -237, and 1,040 S-only files.**
  That 1,040 is the number F4 has to drive to zero or knock out.

  **The gate reads: not ready.** On layout and paint Livery is 241 files
  behind, and the net figure understates the churn. The engines disagree on
  ~1,869 files: **1,055 that Stylo renders and Livery does not** (the real
  F4 regression count) against 814 the other way. CSS2's +115 is the clearest
  trap: a healthy-looking net that hides 449 files which would regress.
  **Net deltas are not the measure here; `S-only` is.**

  This directly contradicts the F3 reading. Testharness put Livery +3,499 and
  concluded "nothing structural remains"; that conclusion was scoped to
  parsing, computed values, and CSSOM, and it does not survive contact with
  layout. **css-flexbox is the cautionary case: +237 on testharness, -127 on
  reftest.** Parsing every flex longhand correctly is not laying flexbox out
  correctly.

  Named clusters, in gate order:
  1. **Flexbox and grid fidelity** (386 files). Taffy implements both
     algorithms, so this is integration and edge-case fidelity, not missing
     capability, and the most tractable large cluster.

     **Sub-diffed 2026-07-25**, same instrument, and the two halves are
     shaped very differently.

     **css-grid (190 S-only, 91 L-only) slices cleanly into 13 buckets:**

     | bucket | S-only | L-only | reading |
     |---|---:|---:|---|
     | abspos | 43 | 7 | **capability gap** |
     | alignment | 30 | 9 | churn |
     | grid-items | 28 | 2 | **capability gap** |
     | grid-lanes | 28 | 52 | churn |
     | subgrid | 15 | 13 | churn |
     | placement | 13 | 0 | **capability gap** |
     | grid-model | 10 | 0 | **capability gap** |
     | grid-definition | 9 | 1 | gap |
     | layout-algorithm | 9 | 0 | **capability gap** |
     | tail (4 buckets) | 5 | 7 | tail |

     By test-name theme the top item is unambiguous: `positioned-grid` (24)
     plus `orthogonal-positioned` (17) is **absolutely positioned grid
     children, about 41 files**, the single densest item in the 386. It is
     also a coherent feature rather than scattered fidelity, so it is the
     one to take first.

     **css-flexbox (196 S-only, 69 L-only) does not slice: 123 buckets, the
     largest 5.1%.** That is the finding. Flexbox is a long tail of
     individual features, so there is no big win available and no reason to
     sequence it ahead of grid. Its densest themes are
     `flex-minimum-*` (16 files, the automatic minimum size of flex items,
     a known spec corner), `table-as-*` (11, tables as flex items),
     `flex-flow` (10), and `flexbox-baseline-*` (9). Expect steady grind
     here, not a breakthrough, and take grid's abspos cluster first.
  2. **CSS2 core** (449 files). The broad fullweb body; needs its own
     sub-diff before it can be sliced, since it spans floats, inline layout,
     tables, and positioning.

     **Instrument spec.** `ledger_reftest_diff.py` already computes the
     per-directory S-only list (`regressions[d]`) and only truncates it at
     ten entries for printing, so the 449 paths exist in the data and no new
     run is needed once `target/ledger-reftest/css_CSS2_{stylo,livery}.json`
     are on disk. The sub-diff is a second reader over the same files:
     bucket each S-only path by its first segment under `css/CSS2/`, and
     bucket the 18 loose top-level files by filename stem prefix (`bidi-*`,
     `css-e-notation-*`, `inline-svg-*`). The real buckets, with corpus
     sizes for weighting (file counts under `tests/wpt/tests/css/CSS2`, not
     pass counts): tables 1239, selectors 1069, normal-flow 1045,
     margin-padding-clear 856, borders 840, positioning 721, text 716,
     backgrounds 694, generated-content 435, css1 392, floats-clear 365,
     fonts 358, syntax 319, lists 313, linebox 311, ui 242, floats 197,
     box-display 169, bidi-text 143, pagination 126, cascade 112, visufx
     104, visuren 89, visudet 61, i18n 57, and a tail of smaller ones.
     Output: bucket, S-only count, share of the 449. That table is what
     makes the cluster sliceable; until it exists, "CSS2 core" names a
     number, not a work item.

     **RUN 2026-07-25.** `docs/tools/ledger_css2_subdiff.py`, over the
     recovered data (below). The 449 spread across **26 buckets with no
     dominant one**: the largest is 12.5%. "CSS2 core" was never one work
     item.

     | bucket | S-only | share | L-only | reading |
     |---|---:|---:|---:|---|
     | normal-flow | 56 | 12.5% | 81 | churn |
     | tables | 55 | 12.2% | 3 | **capability gap** |
     | margin-padding-clear | 50 | 11.1% | 30 | churn |
     | backgrounds | 48 | 10.7% | 22 | churn |
     | positioning | 39 | 8.7% | 85 | churn |
     | borders | 35 | 7.8% | 67 | churn |
     | floats-clear | 27 | 6.0% | 43 | churn |
     | generated-content | 22 | 4.9% | 2 | **capability gap** |
     | fonts | 19 | 4.2% | 16 | churn |
     | syntax | 18 | 4.0% | 1 | **capability gap** |
     | text | 16 | 3.6% | 25 | churn |
     | floats | 15 | 3.3% | 12 | churn |
     | css1 | 9 | 2.0% | 47 | churn |
     | 13 smaller buckets | 40 | 8.9% | 130 | tail |

     A bucket where S-only is large and L-only is near zero is a missing
     capability; one where both are large is bidirectional churn, usually a
     single fidelity bug pulling in both directions. They want different
     work, which is why this table reports both and the F3b headline's net
     delta reports neither.

     **The three capability gaps are far smaller than their file counts,
     because each is dominated by one feature:**

     - **tables (55): 38 files are `fixed-table-layout-003*` variants.** One
       capability, `table-layout: fixed`, not 55 defects. With css-tables'
       own 14, table fidelity is about 69 files behind one feature.
     - **generated-content (22): 19 are `content-*`.** This is the `content`
       longhand, which is **already on F0's 38-item list**. An F0 slice buys
       these reftest files directly; F0 and F3b are not disjoint work.
     - **syntax (18): 12 are `escapes-*` and `uri-*`.** Tokenizer-level, and
       shared with the testharness lane's parsing cluster.

     The two largest churn buckets are also narrower than they look:
     normal-flow's 56 is mostly the sizing family (`max-height` 10,
     `min-width-applies-to` 5, `height` 4, `max-width` 4, plus
     replaced-element heights), which is exactly the "replaced-element
     intrinsic sizing" D0 already named as a lift candidate.
     margin-padding-clear's 50 is 36 `*-applies-to-*` files, one systematic
     pattern rather than 36 bugs.

     **The data.** Recovered 2026-07-25 and preserved at
     `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/` (reftest 18 files, testharness 54).
     It reproduces the F3b table exactly: 5893 / 5652 / -241 / 1055 S-only.
     It was never in `target/`; the originating session wrote it to a
     machine-local scratchpad under `AppData/Local/Temp/claude/`, which is
     disposable. Read it with `LEDGER_OUT` pointed at that directory. No
     re-run is needed for any further CSS2 slicing.
  3. **Background paint** (127 files): sizing, positioning, repeat, and
     layering fidelity in the neutral paint path.
  4. **Multicol** (15 files, but **structurally absent**): `column-count`,
     `column-width`, and `column-span` are all `[[unimplemented]]`, and taffy
     has no multi-column algorithm. This one is build-or-knock-out, not a
     fidelity pass, and the only cluster in either ledger that is
     genuinely structural. **RULED 2026-07-25: knocked out** (see the D0
     riders); the directory leaves the F4 bar.
  5. Writing-modes (35), position (23), tables (14), borders (6): small tails.

  **F4 remains blocked**, and the reopened question is D0's cost basis, not
  its direction. See the D0 note above.
- **F4 - the default flip.**

  **Verified state, 2026-07-25.** The premise "the renderer switch exists
  only in genet-wpt's runner" holds, but the product side is further along
  and worse off than that sentence suggests:

  - The switch is `harness::StyleRoute` at
    `ports/genet-wpt/src/harness.rs:113`, selected by `ReftestRenderer` at
    `ports/genet-wpt/src/main.rs:2035`. Both are harness-local. `StyleRoute`
    appears nowhere under `components/`.
  - `genet-documents` **already carries the product-facing Livery lane**:
    `LiverySessionEngine<Fetch>` implementing `SessionEngine<Scene>`, plus
    `LiveryDocumentSession`, in `components/genet-documents/src/engines.rs`,
    behind the crate's `livery` cargo feature.
  - **No port enables that feature.** `ports/pelt/desktop` turns on
    `scripted`, `netfetch`, and `smolweb`; `livery` appears in no port
    manifest. The one enabler in the workspace is `ports/genet-wpt`, and it
    enables `genet-scripted/livery`, not `genet-documents/livery`.

  So the Livery product lane is written and unreachable: dead code in every
  shipping port. The original plan placed all three corrective moves inside
  F4. That hid the first real product projection behind the final parity bar.
  The first two now belong to the linked product-route plan and must land
  while Stylo remains the default:

  1. **Make the lane reachable.** Enable `genet-documents/livery` in the
     ports and get it building and smoking. Until this lands, every claim
     about Livery in a product is a claim about genet-wpt only, and the
     first turn-on is where lane-versus-harness divergence will surface.
  2. **Promote compile-time to runtime.** The consumed-property audit
     already ruled that a cargo feature selects one engine per build and
     cannot supply per-document engine choice. The seam that can is
     `SessionEngine<Scene>`, which the Stylo lane and `LiverySessionEngine`
     both implement today; the profile tier picks the impl with both in the
     binary. This is a selection point, not a new abstraction.
  F4 retains only the third move: **flip the default** after those opt-in
  product receipts and the parity bar both hold. The fullweb profile routes
  to Livery, with Stylo behind an explicit opt-out that F5 removes.

  **The parity bar, revised 2026-07-25.** Two changes from the original
  wording. First, the measure on the reftest lane is **`S-only`, not net
  delta**; F3b's CSS2 row (+115 net hiding 449 regressions) is why. Second,
  css-multicol leaves the bar per the D0 knockout, which drops the F3b
  numbers to **eight directories, 1,040 S-only files** (1,055 less
  multicol's 15) and a net of -237 (5,787 Stylo, 5,550 Livery). The bar:

  - Reftest lane, over the eight remaining directories: `S-only` is zero,
    or every remaining file is covered by a recorded knockout that names it.
  - Testharness lane: no directory where the Stylo pin beats the Livery pin.
  - The F0 census reads 126/126, from the generator, not by hand.
  - Every pinned baseline re-pinned under the Livery default. The runner
    already enforces this: `check_expectations` rejects a baseline whose
    recorded `renderer` differs from the run's, so stale pins fail loudly
    rather than silently passing.

  Receipt: the bar above holds, and turnstone, isometry, woodshed, and hocket
  build and smoke against genet main with no renderer flag set.
- **F5 - the retirement event.** The harvest plan's trigger fires ("Livery
  takes the fullweb default with WPT parity receipts"; that trigger was
  superseded 2026-08-16, see the revision at the end of this plan). Five steps, each
  separately revertible, in this order:

  1. **Feature-gate genet-layout off the default build.** The first edge to
     cut is `genet-documents`, which carries `genet-layout` and
     `genet-render` as non-optional path deps
     (`components/genet-documents/Cargo.toml:37-38`); they become optional
     behind the Stylo opt-out F4 leaves in place.
  2. **Run F6a's map against the gated build**, not against today's tree.
  3. **Delete genet-layout and its consumer edges** once that map confirms
     nothing left needs them.
  4. **Archive the fork checkout** `Code/crates/stylo`; freeze the
     genet-stylo publish family at its last release.
  5. **Drop stylo_taffy and the vendored patches that exist only for the Stylo
     cone:** `support/patches/{stylo_taffy,ipc-channel,gpu-allocator}`.
     Buckram retains `support/patches/taffy` while its documented flex, float,
     and containment changes are still needed. Each patch leaves only after
     upstream release adoption or an owned Buckram replacement.
     `support/patches/sonic-rs-0.5.8` is unrelated and stays.

  **Verified state, 2026-07-25.** No reverse build edge blocks the gate.
  `components/genet-layout/Cargo.toml` does list `genet-livery`, which would
  be an incumbent-depends-on-challenger cycle, but it is a **dev-dependency
  only**, for `components/genet-layout/tests/livery_parity.rs`. That test is
  the direct Stylo-versus-Livery comparison inside the workspace; it dies
  with genet-layout at step 3, and whatever it still asserts at that point
  should move onto a Livery-only footing first or be retired knowingly.

  Receipt: workspace green with genet-layout absent from the default build,
  then absent from the tree; no `stylo` path remains a build input.
- **F6 - the servo-* teardown** (sequenced here by Mark's ruling).

  **Pre-F5 baseline, verified 2026-07-25.** The workspace carries **48
  `servo-` prefixed packages**. That is the number F6's receipt drives to
  zero, and the denominator for everything below: 15 media, 2 orphans, 31
  survivors to rule on. Largest fan-in, with workspace aliases resolved:
  servo-malloc-size-of 27, servo-base 19, servo-url 11, servo-profile-traits
  11. These are the pre-F5 figures the next bullet exists to invalidate.

  - **F6a: recompute the dependents map after F5.** Today's fan-in counts
    are dominated by the cone F5 deletes; building equivalents for consumers
    that are about to die is waste. **Three scan traps, all live in this
    tree:**
    1. `[target.'cfg(..)'.dependencies]` sections. Missed these on
       2026-07-24 and read the gstreamer render crates as dead.
    2. `package =` renames. Missed these on 2026-07-24 and read
       servo-layout-api as dead. Live examples: `Cargo.toml:384`
       (`media = { package = "servo-media-thread" }`), plus
       `malloc_size_of`, `profile_traits`, and `deny_public_fields`, none of
       which carry the `servo-` prefix at their use sites.
    3. **Feature names colliding with alias names** (found 2026-07-25). A
       scan for the alias `profile` matches
       `support/patches/taffy/Cargo.toml:87`, which is a `[features]` entry
       `profile = ["std"]`, and reports a phantom dependent for
       servo-profile. Resolve aliases from `[workspace.dependencies]` and
       match only inside dependency tables.

    A scan that does not handle all three produces both false "dead crate"
    reads (traps 1 and 2) and false "live crate" reads (trap 3). Wrong in
    either direction costs real work here.
  - **F6b: the free deletions**, 17 crates. The 15-crate
    `components/media/` cluster is self-contained: verified 2026-07-25 that
    every reference to a `servo-media*` name outside `components/media/` is
    a declaration in the root `[workspace.dependencies]` table
    (`Cargo.toml:384`, `414-426`), never a consumer edge; pelt, genet-render,
    genet-scripted, and genet-documents carry zero media references. Plus
    the two orphans: servo-deny-public-fields (0 dependents) and
    servo-profile (0 dependents, once trap 3's phantom is discounted; its
    traits crate servo-profile-traits has 11 and is **not** an orphan).
  - **F6c: survivors get equivalents or die.** For each of the 31 still
    carrying dependents after F6a's post-F5 recount: grow the genet-native
    equivalent (genet-url, genet-pixels, a size-of trait; MIT/Apache where
    the code is clean-room, upstream names like servo-pixels are
    upstream-owned on crates.io and never reused) or delete the capability
    with a recorded knockout decision, in the same form as the multicol
    knockout. The webgl/webxr/webgpu trait family is a capability ruling for
    Mark here, not a naming exercise, and it is the largest single decision
    left in F6.
  - Receipt: zero `servo-` prefixed workspace members (48 today); genet
    workspace green; product smokes green.

## The two ledgers, permanently split

**Ruled 2026-07-26 by Mark**, after the table work exposed the confusion. The
plan had one ledger doing two jobs, and the acceptance gates rewarded the
wrong one.

- **The Stylo differential** answers *is it safe to replace the incumbent*.
  Its measure is `S-only`, the files Stylo renders and Livery does not, and
  it gates F4 and nothing else. It is a replacement-safety instrument. It
  can reach zero while the engine is still far from the specifications,
  because Stylo is not a specification.
- **Absolute Genet CSS conformance** answers *how much of the platform is
  built*. Its measure is **absolute passing subtests over time**, counted
  against the whole corpus and including failures, errors, and tests that
  cannot run at all. It never uses Stylo as the oracle. Each lane names its
  actual owners, including Stylo geometry in the current hybrid testharness
  route, so those results are not misrepresented as Livery layout
  conformance.

The repository already ruled this once and the cutover drifted off it: the
[grand audit](./2026-06-24_grand_audit.md) says "100% WPT is not a real
target... serious engines steer by **absolute passing-subtest count over
time**, not a percentage", and names harness runnability as the binding
constraint because it gates whole directories before any engine work counts.
That rule governs the conformance ledger.

**Why the split has to be permanent.** A differential ledger silently
accepts any bug the incumbent shares, and it rewards emulating the incumbent
over implementing the specification. Both failure modes appeared in one day:
tables were ranked by a differential that neither engine's behaviour
satisfied, and a capability was filed as a spent lever because it closed the
differential. Neither is visible from inside the differential; both are
obvious from an absolute count.

**Consequences for this plan.**

- F4's bar is unchanged and stays differential. Replacing Stylo safely is a
  real goal and `S-only` is the right instrument for it.
- F4 is **no longer sufficient** for anything except the replacement. It is
  not evidence of conformance and must not be quoted as such.
- Every slice reports both numbers, or says plainly that it moved one and
  not the other. A partial capability that moves no files is a legitimate
  result, as fixed-table sizing was.
- The conformance ledger counts what cannot run. Skipped and errored files
  are the largest single unknown in the reftest lane (css-multicol skips 307
  of 708, CSS2 skips 3,279 of 9,254) and a differential hides them entirely,
  because both engines skip the same files.

**Built 2026-07-28:** `genet-wpt conformance` joins exact screen-reftest and
testharness result maps to the authoritative WPT manifest, reports absolute
file and subtest totals, rejects missing or unpinned evidence by default, and
keeps worker-only and unsupported manifest kinds visible. The report names
the routes honestly: Livery owns the screen reftest renderer; testharness uses
Livery CSSOM with Stylo geometry until that half is replaced. Print reftests
remain unsupported until a print harness exists. Its first live diagnostic
proof covers all 9,254 `css/CSS2` manifest variants. See the
[absolute CSS conformance ledger](./2026-07-28_absolute_css_conformance_ledger.md).
The first current whole-`css` baseline is deliberately held until K3s so K3's
runner and expectation stream stay fixed.

## Deferral register

Every capability this plan has left unbuilt, in one place, because they were
previously visible only inside the stage that created them and the aggregate
is what matters. A specification gap is only acceptable in two forms: **built
to spec**, or a **recorded knockout** with a planned rebuild and its
directory removed from the F4 bar. A third state has appeared in practice, an
**emulation** that scores on the ledger while the standard stays unbuilt, and
it is the dangerous one because it reads like completion. Emulations are
listed as such and each needs a ruling that turns it into one of the two
legitimate states.

**Compounds** marks a deferral that gets more expensive the longer it stands,
usually because other code is growing around the wrong behaviour. Those are
the ones to take first, ahead of anything ranked purely by file count.

| capability | state | new or inherited | compounds |
|---|---|---|---|
| multicol (`column-*`) | **recorded knockout**, ruled D0 | inherited | no |
| table model, fixed/auto sizing, rows, spans, captions, colgroups, fixup, and collapsed tracks | **built; K4 closed at `610df0981a8`** | inherited | no |
| collapsed-border conflict, metrics, and paint | **built through accepted K4g** | inherited | no |
| positioned-table closure and compatibility-bridge deletion | **built through accepted K4h** | inherited | no |
| `display` outer/inner roles and admitted normal-flow formatting contexts | **Buckram K0-K3 accepted**; remaining positioned, fragmented, and sizing shapes route to K5-K7 | inherited | no |
| `position: fixed` and `sticky` | live K5 routes with remaining closure work recorded in K5d-K5h | inherited | no |
| CSSOM used values | handwritten per-property list (box-tree B6) | inherited | no |
| block-flow anonymous boxes | **wrong behaviour retained**, scoped away (box-tree B1) | **new** | **yes** |
| `min-content` / `max-content` sizing | admitted Buckram K3 queries built; cycles, percentages, replaced/atomic, and fragmentainer-dependent shapes route to K5-K7 | inherited | **yes** |
| gamut mapping (out-of-gamut colors clip per channel) | not built | inherited | no |
| contextual `color-layers()`, `alpha()`, `contrast-color()`, relative colors, and system colors | absolute forms built; retained contextual computation is C1-C3 | inherited | **yes** |
| `order` with grid auto-placement | not built | inherited | no |
| relative-position table parts | **built through accepted K4h/K5c integration** | **new** | no |

**The two that compound, in detail, because they are the ones that will hurt:**

- **Block-flow anonymous boxes.** Collapsible white space between two block
  boxes generates a box in the text-measuring pass that should not exist.
  Removing it is correct and measured at -131 files on CSS2, because the
  table and inline-formatting emulation has grown to depend on the phantom
  boxes. The rule is therefore scoped to flex and grid containers, where it
  is unambiguously right, and block flow keeps a known-wrong behaviour that
  more code can accrete around. Widening it requires fixing the emulation
  first; the longer both stand, the more entangled they get.
- **`min-content` / `max-content` sizing.** Both collapse to
  `Dimension::auto()`, because taffy's safe `Dimension` constructors cannot
  express content sizes and genet-livery forbids unsafe. The alignment
  consequence is fixed (they no longer stretch), so this now fails
  *quietly*: a `min-content` box is sized as though it were `auto` rather
  than visibly breaking. Quiet wrongness is harder to find later than loud
  wrongness, which is why it is ranked here rather than by its file count.

Nothing in this register is a silent gap: each is named in the code at the
point where it is taken, and this table is the index.

## Non-goals, named

- No re-seam of Stylo into anything after F5; the fallback path lifts
  genet-layout subsystems, not Stylo.
- No new fork divergence beyond keeping the incumbent green until F5.
- No upstream Servo PRs.
- No media-stack replacement at F6b; if a product later wants engine-side
  audio/video it arrives as its own planned capability, not a resurrection.
- No date estimates. The ledger (F3) is the only honest scope instrument for
  the long pole, and receipts gate every flip.

## Sequencing

F0 through F2 ride the current H5 cadence and the live lane session. F3 can
start now in parallel (it is read-only over both renderers). F4 needs D0
confirmed plus F0-F3 receipts. F5 fires the harvest plan's trigger. F6 is
strictly after F5, per the 2026-07-24 ruling, with F6b's media knockout held
to that sequencing even though it is technically independent today.

**Correction 2026-08-15:** product reachability R0-R4 and resource work R5a-R5d
are complete. Pelt now has explicit static and scripted Livery pins over the
shared resource boundary, while its defaults remain incumbent. This closes the
projection gate only; F4 still owns the measured default flip.

**Ordered 2026-07-25 (audit with Mark), and where each stands:**

1. ~~**The two open instruments.**~~ **BOTH DONE.** The CSS2 sub-diff is at
   F3b cluster 2; the css/selectors run landed 2026-07-26 and reads clean
   (see F3). The testharness lane has no unmeasured directory left.
2. ~~**The F0 color slice.**~~ **DONE and measured.** `css/css-color` went
   -451 to **+3091** across two steps, the grammar and then the
   specified-value layer; see F0's receipt table. The F0 instrument landed
   alongside it and its ratchet now stands at 35.
3. ~~**Slice the flexbox/grid cluster.**~~ **DONE** (F3b cluster 1 carries
   both tables). The work it exposes is below.

**New work the sub-diff exposed, in rough value order:**

- ~~**Absolutely positioned grid children**~~ **TAKEN 2026-07-26, and the
  diagnosis was better than this plan's.** The cluster was never layout
  work: taffy 0.12 already implements grid-area containing blocks for
  abspos children, and the failures were **grammar**. The
  `grid-row`/`grid-column`/`grid-area` shorthands were unimplemented, so
  placements never reached taffy and every abspos item fell to the
  padding-box fallback. The reference pages compounded it: they use the
  `grid` and `place-items` shorthands, also unimplemented, so many old
  "passes" were test and reference wrong together. Landed: the three
  placement shorthands, `grid`/`grid-template` (template form; the
  auto-flow forms reject rather than mis-implement), `place-items`, and the
  `align-self`/`justify-items`/`justify-self` longhands with
  `Alignment::Auto` deferring to the parent. F0's ratchet advanced 38 to 35.

  **The residual then turned out to be a second, larger bug: whitespace
  between block siblings generated an anonymous box.** White-space
  processing removes a collapsible run sitting between two block boxes, and
  Livery's preliminary layout pass did drop it; the text-measuring pass did
  not. In block flow the extra empty box is invisible, which is why it
  survived this long. In a grid or flex container every in-flow child
  becomes an item, so the newline-and-indent between two items consumed a
  cell and shifted every following item by one. The flagship test was
  rendering its *reference* wrong, not its test: four items landed in
  column 2 of rows 1-4 instead of filling the 2x2. Fixed by giving the text
  pass the preliminary pass's blank-run rule;
  `components/genet-livery/tests/anonymous_boxes.rs` guards it for grid and
  flex, including that `white-space: pre` still generates its box.

  **The receipt** (data at `wpt-ledger/2026-07-26_scoped/`):

  | css-grid (livery) | files | S-only vs Stylo |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | 2026-07-24 baseline | 371 | 190 |
  | after the grammar slice | 375 | 169 |
  | **after the blank-run fix** | **434** | **114** |

  Stylo is 470 on the same corpus, so the gap closes from 99 files to 36,
  and the flagship reftest is pixel-identical (diff 0, maxδ 0). The plan's
  estimate of "41 files behind one feature" was right in shape; the feature
  was grammar, and behind it sat an engine bug worth more.

  **The blank-run fix was committed once in a wrong form, and the correction
  is the more useful record.** It was landed on css-grid's number alone; a
  refresh of the whole F3b set showed a net loss of 93 files (-128 CSS2, -18
  css-tables, -6 css-position against grid's +62). Bisecting by reverting
  only that hunk put CSS2 at 4263 against a 4264 baseline, which attributed
  the loss precisely and cleared the color, specified-value, and
  grid-grammar work of any part in it. Two defects were behind it:
  `str::trim` treats U+00A0 as whitespace where css-text-3 does not, so
  `&nbsp;` (the standard way a test forces a line box) was being deleted;
  and the rule was applied to every container when css-flexbox section 4 and
  css-grid section 6 state it for flex and grid, which is where it matters.
  In block flow the extra boxes turn out to be load-bearing for the current
  table and inline-formatting emulation. Scoped to those two containers, the
  whole F3b set moves forward and nothing regresses. **The lesson worth
  keeping: a single directory is not a receipt for a change to shared
  layout code.**

  **32 regressions sit inside the churn**, 23 from the grammar slice and 9
  from the blank-run fix, all of them defects the phantom boxes had been
  hiding rather than new breakage. The two named groups:

  - ~~`grid-item-non-auto-height-stretch-001..004`~~ **fixed 2026-07-26.**
    Livery maps the content keywords onto `Dimension::auto()` because
    taffy's safe `Dimension` constructors cannot express them and
    genet-livery forbids unsafe, so taffy saw `auto` and applied the
    container's stretch; css-align permits stretch only when the size
    genuinely computes to `auto`. Suppressed at the alignment layer.
    **Still open behind it:** content keywords reach taffy as `auto` for
    *sizing*, so `min-content` does not size narrower than `max-content`.
  - `order/column-order-property-auto-placement-001..005`: the `order`
    property's effect on auto-placement. Still open.
- **Table layout: emulation improved, standard still unbuilt.** This entry
  used to read `table-layout: fixed` and is reclassified, because the work
  done on 2026-07-26 is not that and must not be filed as though it were.

  What landed is 147 lines of box-tree mapping: a `display: table` box
  collects its cells through the row and row-group nesting and hands each
  one an explicit `(row, column)` on a grid container. It moved **S-only 971
  to 916** across the F3b set (CSS2 449 to 398, css-tables 14 to 8) and is
  structurally much closer to correct than the flex row it replaced.

  **It is not CSS table layout.** Unbuilt: the fixed and auto sizing
  algorithms, colgroups, rowspan and colspan distribution, border-collapse
  conflict resolution, caption placement, and anonymous table-box fixup.

  **The justification originally recorded here was wrong** and is kept
  visible rather than quietly replaced: it argued that the incumbent
  emulates tables the same way and carries the same deferral, so parity is
  on-target. Parity with genet-layout is a milestone, not the goal. This
  project is building a standards-compliant engine, so a capability is
  either implemented to spec or it is a **recorded knockout** with a planned
  rebuild, the way multicol was ruled at D0. An emulation that scores on the
  ledger while leaving the standard unbuilt is neither, and it reads like
  completion, which is the failure mode a knockout exists to prevent.

  **Ruling needed from Mark**, the same shape as the multicol one: either
  css-tables and CSS2/tables leave the F4 parity bar as a recorded knockout
  with table layout scheduled as its own build, or table layout is
  scheduled now and the emulation is labelled a stepping stone with an
  explicit expiry. Until one of those is chosen this entry stays open, and
  the 38-file `fixed-table-layout-003*` family stays unmoved either way.

  css-tables is the row worth remembering: its **file count fell by 3 while
  its S-only fell by 6**. The two move independently and only S-only bears
  on the F4 flip, which is the whole reason F3b leads with it.

  **Still deferred, and now named in the code:** border-collapse, caption
  placement, colgroup, row and column spans, and real fixed or auto table
  sizing. Tracks are implicit and auto-sized, so column widths come from
  content rather than the first row, which is exactly why the 38-file
  `fixed-table-layout-003*` family did not move. That family remains the
  best-defined table work left, and it now needs a sizing algorithm rather
  than a box-tree change.

  A guard rides along: a table containing a `position: relative` row or row
  group keeps the old nesting, because flattening discards an offset the
  cells must inherit and Livery cannot resolve it yet (the incumbent keeps a
  side list of "cells owed a row-relative shift" for this). Without it,
  sixteen `position-relative-table-*` files regress.
- **The `content` longhand.** It is on F0's 38-item list *and* it is 19 of
  CSS2/generated-content's 22 S-only files. One slice, paid twice.
- **`*-applies-to-*`** (36 files in margin-padding-clear, one systematic
  pattern) and the **replaced-element sizing family** in normal-flow (about
  26 files). The latter is D0's other named lift candidate, so measure
  before deciding whether to lift or fix in place.
- **css-flexbox** stays ranked last, now on measurement rather than
  inference. The guess that the blank-run fix might shorten its tail (it
  lives in shared inline construction) was tested on 2026-07-26 and came
  back +8 files, 342 to 350, S-only 196 to 189. The 123-bucket long tail is
  real and there is still no large lever in it.
- **Grid self-alignment against non-auto sizes**, and **`order` with
  auto-placement**: the nine defects the blank-run fix exposed, named
  above.

**Also newly named, from the css-color receipt:**

- ~~Specified-value serialization~~ **DONE 2026-07-25** (`SpecifiedColor`,
  the +1,520 jump in the receipt; see F0).
- ~~`color-layers()` (160), `alpha()` (20), `contrast-color()` (16)~~
  **ABSOLUTE FORMS LANDED 2026-07-28.** Context-dependent uses now belong to
  `2026-07-28_livery_contextual_color_computation_plan.md`; they are a
  computed-value and inheritance seam, not more function-parser work.

Remaining instrument debt: none. The census reports the consumed set, the
ledger is preserved outside `target/`, and the diff readers are checked in.
The sub-diff generalized while being used: `LEDGER_DIR` points it at any
directory, nested corpora bucket by subdirectory and flat ones by test-name
family.

Multicol is out per the D0 riders. The text-editing primitive has its own
founding plan (`2026-07-25_text_editing_primitive_plan.md`) and does not
ride this one. The agent-drives-pelt receipt stays queued per the direction
doc.

## Done condition

The harvest plan's retirement trigger has fired (F5), and F6c's receipt
holds: no workspace member carries the servo- prefix, and nothing outside
git history remembers the fork as a build input.

## Revision, 2026-08-16: the parity trigger and the lift fallback

A full-tree Livery/Stylo reftest differential was measured on the current
branch, the first since K4 closure, K5 and PH4. It changes two of this
plan's load-bearing assumptions.

### The measurement

Over 36311 `css` files, same corpus, same run, zero errored on either side:
Stylo passed 11246, Livery 10147. Per-test rather than net:

- Stylo-only passes: **2568**
- Livery-only passes: **1469**
- both pass: 8678

Stylo-only failures by area: CSS2 464, css-text 330, WOFF2 298,
css-grid 197, css-flexbox 192, css-backgrounds 118, css-conditional 91,
css-images 86.

The stale F4 bar of 901 cannot be carried forward. It was measured against
a knocked-out subset; this is the full tree, so the figures are not
comparable and 2568 is now the reference.

### The trigger is the wrong shape

Two things follow. First, the gap is not mostly layout: grid and flexbox
together are 389 of 2568, while CSS2, css-text and WOFF2 are 1092. So
"finish K5, then the trigger fires" was never going to hold, and continued
K5 investment does not move most of the bar.

Second, parity is not a shape a gate can take here. Livery passes 1469
tests Stylo fails. The engines diverge in both directions rather than
converging on a line Livery must reach, so a catch-up gate cannot fire
while also hiding where Livery is already ahead.

The retirement trigger therefore moves from WPT parity to a dogfooding
gate: a named set of real pages and flows that must work, chosen because
we use them. Sampling two of the largest non-layout blocks found nothing
to lift. `hanging-punctuation` is absent from Livery's property catalog
entirely, so css-text is unbuilt surface rather than broken behaviour, and
the `css/WOFF2/` directory is format validation against a font stack, not
a Livery layout gap. CSS2 at 464 is the largest block and remains
unexamined; it is the one most likely to hold genuinely liftable behaviour.

### The lift fallback is withdrawn

"The genet-layout lift fallback stays in reserve" above no longer holds,
and should not be relied on as insurance.

Our stylo fork tips at `b157d92526` (2026-07-19), a `genet-stylo 0.19.1`
release commit on a lineage deliberately diverged from `servo/stylo`. A
fork held as a quarry has no cheap-and-valuable state: left alone its
worth as a source decays continuously, so the insurance is worthless
exactly when reached for; kept synced, it costs the maintenance that
retirement was meant to shed. Worse, lifting from a frozen fork imports
fork-time bugs while cutting us off from the upstream fixes that followed,
which makes it worse than reading upstream cold.

**Rule: if a Stylo behaviour is ever needed, take it from upstream
`servo/stylo` and decompose that into Livery's catalog. Never from our
fork.** This is the assumption most likely to be got wrong later, because
the fork is ours and therefore looks free.

### What this authorises now

F5's first step, feature-gating genet-layout off the default build, is
taken now rather than after the receipts, because its cost is paid on
every dependency bump. The taffy 0.13 bump on 2026-08-16 paid it three
times: the `stylo_taffy` GridTemplateAreas conversion, the
`Display::FlowRoot` arm in genet-layout, and absorbing the bump twice.

genet-layout stays buildable as a differential oracle only, and that role
is time-boxed. Staleness degrades an oracle far more slowly than a quarry,
but not indefinitely; a fork measuring a year behind is a straw man. It
does not return to the default build.

### The goal, restated (ruled 2026-08-16)

The implicit goal this plan inherited, "replace Stylo," is retired along
with its parity trigger. The ruled goal:

**One owned styling-and-layout system that serves every lane of the
platform (web content, host UI, canvas swatches, smolweb), where each
capability is a catalog entry with a receipt, sized by what we dogfood
rather than by the W3C surface.** Fullweb fidelity is a market this
system serves as far as the dogfooding gate demands, not the identity of
the project.

Why the owned pair over upstream Stylo as a dependency (the one honest
form of "staying", after the fork's withdrawal above):

- The accounting was never one crate into two. Stylo never did layout;
  the incumbent lane was always Stylo plus genet-layout. Livery and
  Buckram replace the pair role for role, split on the seam CSS itself
  draws: computed versus used values.
- Measured 2026-08-16: incumbent ~172k LOC (stylo/style 133.8k +
  genet-layout 38.4k, excluding Stylo's sibling crates and Mako
  machinery) against ~82k for livery 20.9k + genet-livery 36.9k +
  buckram 24.3k, with the taffy fork carrying an 879-line delta on
  upstream. Half the code, 90% of the reftest passes, and 1469 reftests
  the incumbent fails.
- The catalog is data: a 2,774-line TOML property database plus codegen.
  Subsetting for wasm size, knockouts with receipts, and the smolweb and
  host-UI styling lanes all depend on that; Stylo's Mako-generated
  property space is consumed whole or not at all.
- Retained layout with identities (K5's containing-block graph, static
  positions, dirty-root relayout) is what an interactive application
  host sits on. Servo layout is batch-shaped and upstream Stylo does not
  touch layout at all, so no form of "stay" provides it.

The cost, stated once so it is never discovered: every bug is ours, the
coverage climb is ours, and nobody upstreams fixes to us. The
Livery/Stylo differential above is the instrument that keeps that cost
visible while the oracle lasts.
