# Livery contextual color computation plan

**Date:** 2026-07-28
**Status:** corrective F0 subplan. C0 through C3 are complete.

**Parent:** `2026-07-24_livery_fullweb_cutover_and_servo_retirement_plan.md`

**K4 consumer lane:** [Buckram K4 completion
lane](2026-08-08_buckram_k4_completion_lane.md). C1 is its B0 gate; C2 and C3
land separately before collapsed-border headed paint.

This seam is now an explicit K4g dependency. K4g1 landed first because its
candidate topology is generic over color and has no Livery adapter. C1 must
close before K4g2's adapter commits a border-color representation. C2 and C3
must close before K4g5 accepts headed collapsed-border paint, whose winning
border must resolve `currentcolor` and system colors in the winning element's
computed and used contexts.

## Why this is a separate seam

The modern color parser and retained `SpecifiedColor` syntax are real, but
they do not yet form Livery's computed color model. Generated declarations
still parse color-bearing properties directly into the eager, `Copy`
`Color` leaf. That leaf can represent an absolute color, bare
`currentcolor`, or a system-color keyword, but it cannot retain a function
whose result depends on either one.

This makes the current behavior structurally wrong in two directions:

- `color-mix()`, relative colors, `alpha()`, `contrast-color()`, and
  `color-layers()` reject valid `currentcolor` operands before cascade.
- system colors resolve through one built-in light palette without the
  element's used `color-scheme`.

The CSS model requires contextual expressions to survive until their
specified dependencies are known. Extending the eager leaf parser or adding
hidden per-property sidecars would create two authorities for one value.
Inheritance, generated copies, CSS-wide keywords, animation, CSSOM, and paint
would then have to keep an absolute cache and a retained tree synchronized.
This plan instead gives every color-bearing property one authoritative
computed expression.

Normative anchors:

- CSS Color 4, [resolving other colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/#resolving-other-colors)
- CSS Color 5, [`color-mix()`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#color-mix)
  and [contextual resolution](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#resolving-color-mix)
- CSS Color 6, [resolving `color-layers()`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-6/#resolving-layers)
- CSS Color Adjustment, [element `color-scheme`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust-1/#color-scheme-prop)

## Owning model

Keep `Color` as the resolved numeric leaf used by color algorithms and paint.
Generalize the retained syntax into a shared expression shape:

```text
ColorExpression<Leaf>
  Absolute(Color)
  CurrentColor
  System(SystemColor)
  Relative(...)
  Mix(...)
  Alpha(...)
  Contrast(...)
  Layers(...)
```

`SpecifiedColor` is the parsed form. `ComputedColor` is the sole value stored
by computed color-bearing properties. It contains computed children, retains
`CurrentColor` where inheritance requires it, and contains no unresolved
system-color leaf.

The boundary APIs are:

```text
SpecifiedColor::to_computed(ColorComputeContext, ColorRole) -> ComputedColor
ComputedColor::resolve_used(UsedColorContext) -> Color
ComputedColor::to_computed_css(UsedColorContext) -> String
```

`ColorRole::Foreground` is special. A `currentcolor` expression used by the
`color` property resolves against the inherited used foreground before the
new foreground is inherited. Other roles retain `CurrentColor` in the
computed expression so an inherited background, border, decoration, shadow,
or gradient re-resolves against the descendant's foreground.

## C0: correct the contract

**Status:** complete on `main` at the merge of `codex/livery-color-functions`.

- Replace tests and plan language that describe rejecting contextual
  functions as correct.
- Add declaration-level red tests for all five contextual families. A
  `SpecifiedColor` CSSOM round trip is not a cascade receipt.
- Pin the absolute-function result counts from the 2026-07-28 color slice as
  the non-regression baseline while contextual tests remain red.

### Measured state, 2026-07-31

The two layers disagree, which is the whole seam in one observation.

`tests/color.rs` shows the specified parser retaining contextual expressions
correctly: `alpha(from currentcolor / 0.5)` round trips and `resolved()`
returns `None`. But every one of the five families is rejected one layer
lower, at the declaration parser:

```text
DeclarationError { name: "background-color",
  value: "color-mix(in srgb, currentcolor 100%, white)", kind: InvalidValue }
```

So the retained syntax is real and unreachable. Any receipt drawn from
`SpecifiedColor` serialization overstates what the cascade actually accepts.
This is the specific trap C0 exists to close, and reading the round-trip tests
alone is enough to fall into it.

### Receipt

- `components/livery/tests/contextual_color.rs`: six declaration-level and
  cascade-level tests covering `color-mix()`, relative colors, `alpha()`,
  `contrast-color()`, and `color-layers()`. All six are `#[ignore]`d with the
  sub-gate that unblocks each, so the wall stays green and the seam stays
  visible. Run them with `--include-ignored`.
- Non-regression baseline: `cargo test -p livery --test color` is 55 passed,
  0 failed. `cargo test -p livery` is 0 failed across all targets.

### Correction to this gate's done-condition

C0 was written with the done-condition "valid contextual declarations enter the
cascade without being discarded or replaced by black." That is C1's outcome,
not C0's: no amount of contract correction makes a declaration parse while the
computed property is still an eager `Color`. C0's own work is the contract and
the red tests, and that is what is complete. The original sentence now serves
as C1's acceptance condition.

## C1: one authoritative computed color

Ownership:

- `components/livery/src/values/color/{specified,mod,relative,mix,alpha,contrast,layers}.rs`
- `components/livery/build.rs`
- `components/livery/src/cascade.rs`
- `components/livery/src/values/property.rs`

Work:

- Generalize the retained tree into specified and computed expressions with
  recursive computation and used-value resolution.
- Remove parse-time palette lookup and context-free
  `SystemColor::used_srgb()`.
- Make generated color fields non-`Copy`; generated `for_child`, get, set,
  and CSS-wide-keyword paths clone the one authoritative value.
- Parse declarations and `var()` substitutions as `SpecifiedColor`, not
  eager `Color`.
- Migrate nested color owners in the same slice: gradients in
  `BackgroundImage`, `BoxShadow`, and text-decoration aliases. Record an
  explicit scope knockout for any additional owner rather than silently
  routing it through eager `Color`.

Done when direct declarations, `var()`, `inherit`, `unset`, generated copies,
and nested color owners all preserve contextual expressions through cascade.

### C1 receipt - 2026-08-08

**Entry:** `main` at `4c3c304206900e42ea877936a7f901e1f447ed96`.

`ComputedColor` is now the one non-`Copy` value carried by every generated
`<color>` longhand. It owns either an absolute color, `currentcolor`, a system
keyword, or the retained contextual expression. Generated child copies,
tagged get/set, CSS-wide keywords, border shorthands, and deferred `var()`
substitution all clone that one value. `BackgroundImage` gradients and
`BoxShadow` use the same type; text-decoration aliases use the generated
longhand family.

`Color` remains the numeric leaf only. `SystemColor::used_srgb()` is gone;
system lookup is an explicit used-value context supplied at lowering. The
temporary legacy palette preserves the existing consumer output, but is not
part of parsing or computed-value construction and will be replaced by C2's
scheme-aware host palette.

**Scope knockout:** the bounded Livery model has no other implemented nested
CSS color owner. `text-shadow` remains a known-unimplemented property, so it
does not receive an eager-color side path in this gate.

**Focused receipt:** `contextual_color` now proves direct declarations,
`var()`, `inherit`, `unset`, generated copies, two-stop gradients, box
shadows, and text-decoration preserve an expression. The five C2/C3 resolution and observability
fixtures remain ignored: this gate neither selects an element scheme nor
claims CSSOM, animation, or headed-paint semantics.

**Verification:**

- `cargo test -p livery --test contextual_color --offline`: 2 passed, 5
  intentionally ignored;
- `cargo test -p livery --offline`: 170 passed, 5 intentionally ignored;
- `cargo test -p buckram --lib --offline`: 172 passed;
- `cargo test -p genet-livery --all-targets --offline`: 195 passed;
- the combined strict Clippy command is blocked outside C1: 146 existing
  Livery selector/color-space warnings and three existing
  `genet-livery/src/table_sizing.rs` test initializers rejected by Rust 1.97;
  after boxing the retained expression, it reports no C1 warning;
- `cargo build -p genet-wpt --release --all-features --offline`: passed;
- `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check` on all touched Rust paths; and
- `git diff --check`.

**Code checkpoint:** `11a22ee9ac3` holds the C1 implementation inside the
shared in-flight checkpoint. The B0 receipt commit records only this evidence;
it does not include table work.

**Next:** C2 supplies `color-scheme`, element-context computation, and the
host-owned system palette. C3 owns the full CSSOM, animation, and paint
consumer migration; this receipt does not credit that work.

## C2: explicit computed-value context

Ownership:

- `components/livery/properties.toml`
- `components/livery/src/media.rs`
- `components/livery/src/cascade.rs`
- `components/genet-livery/src/style.rs`

Work:

- Implement inherited `color-scheme` as `normal` or an ordered supported
  scheme list with the `only` flag.
- Separate the host preference used by `prefers-color-scheme` from each
  element's used color scheme.
- Add a host-owned `SystemPalette` keyed by used scheme and `SystemColor`.
- Compute in dependency order: custom values and the `color-scheme` winner;
  element used scheme; foreground `color` against inherited foreground; then
  all remaining color-bearing values.
- Resolve system colors to absolute colors before inheritance. Preserve
  non-foreground `CurrentColor` expressions across inheritance.

Done when a directly specified system color follows the child's scheme while
an inherited system color remains the parent's already-computed absolute
value.

### C2 receipt - 2026-08-08

`color-scheme` is now an inherited generated property. `ColorSchemeList`
retains `normal`, author order for the supported `light` and `dark` schemes,
and the `only` flag. Its used scheme chooses the host preference when that
scheme is supported, otherwise the first author-supported scheme. The host
preference remains `Device::color_scheme`, which continues to own
`prefers-color-scheme`; element selection never mutates it.

`Device` also owns a configurable `SystemPalette`, keyed by used scheme and
`SystemColor`. `ColorComputeContext` enters the Livery cascade through
`genet-livery`'s retained style walk. Cascade now resolves the winning
`color-scheme`, then foreground `color` against the inherited foreground, and
then system-color leaves in other color-bearing values. A direct system value
therefore becomes absolute before a child can inherit it, while a
non-foreground `currentcolor` expression remains contextual for C3.

The direct C2 receipt injects distinct light and dark `Canvas` and
`CanvasText` values. A child with `color-scheme: only dark` receives the dark
values despite a light host preference; a sibling that inherits the parent's
light `Canvas` receives that already-computed light value. It also checks
border, gradient, and shadow system leaves are absolute. The retained-style
receipt proves the same distinction reaches `StylePlane` without changing the
host preference.

This C2 receipt stopped before C3. The separate C3 receipt below owns its
CSSOM, invalidation, non-foreground `currentcolor`, animation, and paint
consumer work.

**Verification:**

- `cargo test -p livery --test contextual_color --offline -j 1`: 4 passed,
  4 C3 receipts remain intentionally ignored;
- `cargo test -p livery --offline -j 1`: no failures; and
- `cargo test -p genet-livery --all-targets --offline -j 1`: no failures,
  including the retained-style, invalidation, and 62-test paint suites.

## C3: observables and consumers

Ownership:

- `components/genet-livery/src/style.rs`
- `components/genet-livery/src/paint.rs`
- `components/genet-livery/src/text.rs`
- `components/genet-livery/src/document.rs`
- animation and interpolation paths in `document.rs` and
  `components/livery/src/values/mod.rs`

Work:

- Serialize computed colors with the element's used foreground context.
- Route backgrounds, borders, decoration, gradients, shadows, and text
  through `ComputedColor::resolve_used`.
- Remove the black fallback for unresolved valid colors.
- Expose checked preferred-scheme and palette setters that invalidate style
  and paint.
- Interpolate resolved computed endpoints. Contextual endpoints must not fall
  into an accidental discrete-animation path.

Done when CSSOM and headed paint agree after inheritance, element-scheme
changes, palette changes, and an animation sample.

## Acceptance receipts

Focused unit and retained-document receipts:

1. `background-color: contrast-color(currentcolor)` changes with the
   element's used foreground and produces no diagnostic.
2. An inherited `color-mix(... currentcolor ...)` background re-evaluates on
   a child with a different `color`.
3. A nested `color: color-mix(... currentcolor ...)` resolves against the
   inherited foreground before its result is inherited.
4. Injected light and dark palettes distinguish direct system-color use from
   inherited system-color use; computed CSS contains no system keyword.
5. Preference and palette mutation invalidate both CSSOM and headed paint.

Selected WPT gates:

- `css/css-color/color-mix-currentcolor-nested-for-color-property.html`
- `css/css-color/contrast-color-currentcolor-inherited.html`
- `css/css-color/relative-currentcolor-*`
- `css/css-color/parsing/alpha-color-{parsing-valid,computed}.html`
- computed contrast, relative-color, and valid `color-layers()` tests

- `css/css-color-adjust/parsing/color-scheme-*`
- `css/css-color-adjust/rendering/dark-color-scheme/color-scheme-system-colors.html`

## Stop rules

- Stop if the implementation adds a public `Color` field plus a hidden AST
  sidecar.
- Stop if any system color resolves during parsing or remains unresolved
  after computed-value generation.
- Stop if an inherited non-foreground `currentcolor` expression freezes to
  the parent's RGBA.
- Stop if a foreground `currentcolor` expression re-evaluates on every
  descendant.
- Stop if element scheme is inferred only from the media preference.
- Stop if paint retains a black fallback for a valid unresolved expression.
- Do not call the seam complete while gradients, shadows, or animation
  silently retain the eager `Color` path.

### C3 receipt - 2026-08-08

`StylePlane` retains the actual `ColorComputeContext` and derives a
per-element `UsedColorContext`. CSSOM serialization and a cloned paint view
lower foreground-dependent colors, background images and gradient stops, box
shadows, and borders through that context. Paint no longer has a legacy or
black compatibility fallback: an unlowered valid color is an invariant
failure. Generated `text-decoration-color` is lowered for CSSOM; the current
paint list has no separate decoration primitive.

`LiveryDocument` now exposes checked preferred-scheme and system-palette
setters. A real change clears retained style/layout/paint state; a repeated
value returns false without invalidation. Transition and keyframe endpoints
are lowered in their respective old and new element contexts before numerical
interpolation, so contextual colors do not take the generic discrete path.

The retained-document receipt covers inherited `currentcolor` in CSSOM and
paint backgrounds, gradients, all border sides, shadows, and text; CSSOM
text-decoration color; `contrast-color(currentcolor)`; direct versus inherited
system colors; preference and palette invalidation; and a midpoint contextual
transition sample.

**Verification:**

- `cargo test -p livery --test contextual_color --offline -j 1`: 4 passed;
  4 cascade-only C3 receipts remain explicitly ignored because they do not
  construct a retained element context;
- `cargo test -p livery --offline -j 1`: no failures;
- `cargo test -p genet-livery --test contextual_consumers --offline -j 1`:
  6 passed; and
- `cargo test -p genet-livery --all-targets --offline -j 1`: no failures.

The named selected WPT gates remain unmeasured. C3 is a retained-style and
headed-paint receipt, not a WPT-conformance claim.
