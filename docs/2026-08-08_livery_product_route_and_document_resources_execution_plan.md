# Livery product route and shared document resources execution plan

**Date:** 2026-08-08

**Status:** R0-R4 and R5a-R5c landed 2026-08-08. R5a carries redirect-final
stylesheet identity, response type, and bounded `@import` expansion through
the opt-in Livery route. R5b carries direct stylesheet ownership and live
insert/remove, media, and URL reconciliation through the scripted Livery
consumer. R5c projects loaded import parent-child ownership through CSSOM.
The collapsed-border case remains a named K4g deferral; its caption wrapping
is covered by the product scene and headed receipt. R5 remains a cutover
prerequisite for cache policy and host fetch policy. This plan stops with an
explicit Pelt Livery route; it does not flip the static or fullweb default.

## Ruling

Livery reaches Pelt before F4 as an explicit, user-selectable engine. The
projection must use the same host-owned document resources as the incumbent
route. A stylesheet or image does not belong to Stylo or Livery merely because
one engine consumes it first.

The shared boundary is a resolved document resource set:

- document base identity;
- ordered inline and linked author stylesheets;
- each stylesheet's own source URL and media condition;
- host-fetched image and font bytes keyed by authored and resolved URL; and
- explicit diagnostics for dependencies the selected engine cannot yet load.

Pelt owns network policy and engine choice. A neutral Genet resource component
owns HTML discovery, URL resolution, ordering, and byte attribution. Livery
owns CSS parsing and cascade. Buckram receives only computed styles and layout
inputs.

## Why this gate moved ahead of F4

The cutover plan originally placed product reachability, runtime selection,
and the default flip together. That allowed all Livery evidence to come from
`genet-wpt` while the shipping port could not instantiate the engine.

The live product seam is narrower and more revealing:

- `components/genet-documents/src/engines.rs` already contains
  `LiverySessionEngine<Fetch>` under the `livery` feature;
- `inker::SessionRegistry` and `ENGINE_GENET_LIVERY` already provide runtime
  identity and an explicit pin;
- no port enables `genet-documents/livery` (`genet-wpt` reaches Livery
  directly through `genet-livery` and `genet-scripted/livery`, bypassing the
  session engine);
- Pelt's static surface still calls the incumbent convenience path directly;
  and
- the Livery session currently combines host CSS with
  `genet_layout::inline_stylesheets`, so a normal
  `<link rel="stylesheet">` page loses its authored presentation.

The Merely headed smoke from the Pelt plan depends on linked CSS. It is the
first product falsifier for this route, not a decorative screenshot.

## Standards boundary

HTML treats each stylesheet link as its own external resource and evaluates
its `media` condition against the environment. Its URL resolves against the
link processing base. CSS cascade order treats independently linked sheets in
document linking order and imported sheets at the location of their
`@import` rule.

Normative anchors:

- [HTML link processing](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-link-element)
- [HTML stylesheet links](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-stylesheet)
- [CSS cascade order](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-5/#cascade-order)

The current byte-only `ResourceFetcher` cannot verify HTTP content type,
redirect-final URL, CORS mode, integrity, or response caching metadata. R0-R4
must not claim those behaviors. R5 either enriches the host response contract
or retains each as a named cutover blocker.

## Live ownership defects

1. `components/genet-layout/host_loader.rs` owns generic HTML resource
   discovery even though `genet-layout` is the Stylo retirement target.
2. `LoadedDocument` has the best product resource assembly, but its cache and
   loader are private to the incumbent static session.
3. `LiverySessionEngine` scans already-known CSS for `url(...)` and the DOM
   for `<img>`, but discovers only inline stylesheets.
4. `ports/genet-wpt/src/render.rs` has a separate Livery resource path,
   including fonts. Its success is harness evidence, not product evidence.
5. `genet-scripted` also consumes the generic stylesheet helpers
   (`author_stylesheets_with_loader`, `inline_stylesheets`), so moving them
   into `genet-documents` would create the wrong dependency direction.
6. `genet-scripted`'s livery lane keeps a further private inline-stylesheet
   walk (`components/genet-scripted/livery.rs`), a fifth discovery copy the
   shared component must absorb or explicitly excuse.

The product consumers are the incumbent static session, the Livery session,
and the scripted profile; `genet-wpt` is a fourth call site at harness tier.
The common resource component is justified; another copy is not.

## Target contracts

The exact Rust spelling can change in R0. These distinctions may not:

```rust
pub struct ResolvedDocumentResources {
    pub document_url: Option<String>,
    pub stylesheets: Vec<ResolvedStylesheet>,
    pub resources: Vec<ResolvedResource>,
    pub diagnostics: Vec<ResourceDiagnostic>,
}

pub struct ResolvedStylesheet {
    pub owner: StylesheetOwner,
    pub source_url: Option<String>,
    pub media: Option<String>,
    pub text: String,
    pub document_order: u64,
}

pub struct ResolvedResource {
    pub kind: ResourceKind,
    pub authored_url: String,
    pub resolved_url: String,
    pub bytes: Vec<u8>,
}
```

Required invariants:

1. Inline and linked sheets share one document-order walk.
2. An inline sheet resolves relative URLs against the document URL; a linked
   sheet resolves them against its own URL.
3. Media remains metadata until the style engine evaluates it. Wrapping
   fetched text in an invented `@media` string is a migration behavior, not
   the target model.
4. Fetch policy, redirects, caches, and byte limits remain host authority.
5. A missing or unsupported dependency is observable. It never becomes an
   empty successful resource.
6. Engine consumers cannot mutate the shared set or fetch ambient URLs behind
   the host's back.

## Execution gates

| Gate | Outcome |
|---|---|
| R0 | neutral resource model and frozen incumbent behavior |
| R1 | shared HTML stylesheet discovery and URL attribution |
| R2 | Livery consumes the shared resource set |
| R3 | Pelt exposes an explicit Livery engine pin |
| R4 | local and headed real-page receipts |
| R5 | cutover-grade imports, response metadata, and dynamic resource updates |

### R0. Model and baseline

Create `components/genet-document-resources` as the engine-neutral owner of
the contracts above. It is a full component rather than a
`components/shared` contract crate because it owns discovery behavior, not
just types. It may depend on `layout-dom-api` and the
`genet-host-api::ResourceFetcher` contract. It must not depend on
`genet-layout`, `genet-livery`, `genet-scripted`, a port, or a concrete
network engine.

Before moving behavior, freeze fixtures for:

- interleaved `<style>` and `<link rel=stylesheet>` order;
- a relative link under a document base;
- one screen and one print media condition;
- a linked sheet with a relative image and font URL; and
- unavailable, invalid UTF-8, and unsupported-scheme resources.

**Receipt:** the new crate has model tests, while the incumbent static Pelt
scene and the Merely headed smoke are byte- or pixel-equivalent to their
accepted G7 receipts.

**Stop:** do not mint a third fetch trait. Two byte-only traits already
exist: `genet_host_api::ResourceFetcher` and the duplicate
`genet_scripted::ResourceFetcher`, and `engines.rs` bridges both today. The
neutral crate binds the `genet-host-api` contract only; R1 folds the
`genet-scripted` duplicate onto it when the helpers move, or records the
hold as a named leftover. Adapt the host byte contract until R5 proves
response metadata is required.

### R1. Shared discovery

Move the DOM walk, `rel` token handling, media capture, and URL attribution
out of `genet-layout/host_loader.rs`. Migrate `LoadedDocument` first. Keep a
temporary `genet-layout` re-export only for consumers that have not moved in
this gate. The private inline walk in `genet-scripted/livery.rs` either
adopts the shared discovery here or records why a scoped-subtree variant
stays.

The accepted path must preserve document order across inline and linked
sheets and retain each linked sheet's base identity. Fetch-free parses retain
inline sheets and explicitly diagnose that linked resources have no byte
authority.

**Removal receipt:** the incumbent static session no longer obtains generic
stylesheet discovery from `genet-layout` internals.

### R2. Livery consumption

Make `LiverySessionEngine` consume the same `ResolvedDocumentResources`.
Delete its private `url(...)`/`<img>` discovery once equivalent typed resource
inputs reach `LiveryDocument::set_image_resource` and `set_font_resource`.

Livery receives ordered stylesheet records, not concatenated text. `StyleSet`
must preserve owner identity so CSSOM and future invalidation can attribute a
rule to the correct sheet.

`@import` is not currently represented by Livery's `CssRule`. R2 reports
`ImportRulePendingR5` when a leading import is encountered. It does not strip
the rule and present the remaining sheet as complete support.

**Receipt:** both static engine pins consume one resolved resource set from
the same local document, and the authored color, linked image, and
screen-media results match through both. The linked font presents through
the Livery pin only: the incumbent's webfont deferral is a recorded
diagnostic, not a failure (its own receipt states image resources preload
while webfont support stays deferred). This gate is also where the product
Livery session first receives font bytes; today only the `genet-wpt`
harness feeds `set_font_resource`. The Livery ledger names every
unsupported dependency.

### R3. Pelt engine pin

Add a `livery` Pelt feature that enables `genet-documents/livery` without
removing the incumbent. Register `StaticSessionEngine` and
`LiverySessionEngine` in the product session registry. Extend Pelt's engine
selection with the existing `genet.livery` identity; do not create a second
Livery engine name.

Pelt does not use the session registry today; its static surface calls
`LoadedDocument` directly. The Livery pin is registry-routed from the start.
Rerouting the static path through the registry is optional in this gate and
requires re-blessing the frozen G7 receipts.

The choice must remain user-configurable at runtime when both engines are in
the binary. File type, URL scheme, or compile-time feature order must not
silently select Livery.

**Receipt:** `pelt --engine livery <fixture>` reaches a
`LiveryDocumentSession`; `--engine static` reaches the incumbent; an
unavailable pin fails with the missing engine id rather than falling back.

### R4. Product projection

Run the explicit Livery route against:

1. a local interleaved inline/linked stylesheet fixture;
2. `https://merelyllc.com` with its accepted parchment and oxblood colors;
3. a table fixture covering separate borders, captions, and one
   collapsed-border case recorded as a pass or a named deferral against the
   in-execution K4g plan;
4. a page with a linked image and local webfont; and
5. a viewport resize followed by link hit testing and scroll.

Preserve scene snapshots and headed screenshots outside Git, with a small
checked-in receipt recording engine id, viewport, resource identities, frame
count, and diagnostics.

**Stop after R4.** Livery remains opt-in. F0, F3/F4, Buckram, contextual
color, and presentational-hint gaps remain independent gates.

### R5. Cutover-grade resource graph

Before F4, close or explicitly knock out:

- `@import` ordering, media, layer, supports, cycles, and sheet-relative URLs;
- stylesheet response type and redirect-final identity;
- dynamic linked-sheet insertion/removal and media mutation;
- CSSOM owner-sheet identity;
- cache invalidation and resource replacement; and
- host limits for bytes, nesting depth, redirects, and concurrent fetches.

R5 must decide whether `ResourceFetcher` grows a response type. That decision
is made from these consumers and receipts, not from the full Fetch standard in
the abstract.

#### R5a. Response identity and import graph

`ResourceFetcher::fetch_response` now carries final URL, `Content-Type`, and
bytes while leaving existing byte-only hosts source-compatible. The shared
resolver retains both the requested and final stylesheet URLs, admits only
`text/css` when a type is known, and expands leading imports before their
parent stylesheet. It preserves sheet-relative bases after redirects, wraps
import media in a nested `@media` gate, diagnoses cycles and out-of-order
imports, and exposes host-configurable depth and stylesheet-byte limits.

`@import layer(...)` and `@import supports(...)` remain explicit diagnostics:
the current Livery cascade does not have those import semantics, so fetching
and flattening them would be incorrect. The R5a receipt names the remaining
dynamic and CSSOM ownership work.

#### R5b. Live direct-sheet ownership

`LiveryCssom::install_live` resolves the mutable `ScriptedDom` through the
same `ResolvedDocumentResources` and host-selected `ResourceLimits` path as
the static Livery route. Before computed-style or `document.styleSheets`
access, it recognizes document mutation, rebuilds the shared resource set,
and retains the parsed direct stylesheet object when its owning element and
resource identity are unchanged. Thus CSSOM rule mutation survives unrelated
document-sheet insertions, removals, and reordering.

Document stylesheet entries use stable opaque owner keys rather than their
current list positions. The DOM bridge exposes each direct sheet's
`CSSStyleSheet.ownerNode`; imported sheets remain absent from the document
list. The live receipt covers inserted and removed `<style>` and `<link>`
elements, `media` and `href` mutation, linked-resource replacement and
failure, stable wrapper identity, and CSSOM rule retention.

R5b does not expose `CSSImportRule` or imported child `CSSStyleSheet` objects,
so imported sheets have no JavaScript `ownerRule` relationship yet. It also
does not turn the static Pelt session into a scripted live-document route,
revalidate cache entries, or add shared redirect/concurrency policy beyond
the host transport's existing cap. Those remain named R5/F4 work.

#### R5c. Imported-sheet CSSOM ownership

The engine-neutral resource graph retains each leading import's authored URL,
resolved URL, media condition, loaded child identity, and parent import slot.
The resolver continues to own fetch and diagnostics; Livery only translates
the retained graph into a CSSOM projection.

Loaded imports are now available as leading `CSSImportRule` entries in their
parent sheet. `CSSImportRule.styleSheet` returns a stable child
`CSSStyleSheet`; the child reports the same rule through `ownerRule` and has a
null `ownerNode`. Opaque sheet keys remain strings end to end, avoiding loss
of DOM identities in JavaScript. Imported children never enter
`document.styleSheets`.

This is an ownership projection, not a full CSS rule-object implementation.
`CSSRuleList.item()` still returns only import rules, and mutation of an
import rule itself reports `SyntaxError`; ordinary rules in a loaded imported
sheet continue to accept `insertRule` and `deleteRule`. Cache revalidation,
shared redirect/concurrency policy, dynamic image/font replacement, and a
scripted product-route session remain named R5/F4 work.

## Verification ladder

Every behavior-changing gate runs:

```powershell
cargo test -p genet-document-resources --offline
cargo test -p genet-layout --offline
cargo test -p genet-scripted --features livery --offline
cargo test -p genet-documents --all-features --offline
cargo test -p livery -p genet-livery --all-targets --offline
cargo test -p pelt-desktop --all-targets --offline
cargo clippy -p genet-document-resources -p genet-documents -p genet-livery --no-deps --offline -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
git diff --check
```

`genet-layout` and `genet-scripted` run because R1 moves code out of one and
both consume the moved helpers. `livery` runs because R2's import diagnostic
sits at its rule model. The `pelt-desktop` run adds `--features livery` from
R3 onward; the feature does not exist before R3.

Headed evidence uses the fixed viewport and bounded frame controls from the
Pelt presentability plan. A Stylo route result is regression evidence only; a
Livery-headed frame is the product proof.

## Stop rules

- Stop if Livery imports `genet-layout` to obtain resource discovery.
- Stop if Pelt grows another HTML/CSS resource walker.
- Stop if stylesheet order is reconstructed after separate inline and linked
  passes.
- Stop if every stylesheet uses the document URL as its resource base.
- Stop if a missing dependency is represented as successful empty bytes.
- Stop if the Pelt feature changes the default engine before F4.
- Stop if WPT-only output is credited as the R4 product receipt.

## Done condition

This plan's first execution slice is done at R4 when Pelt can explicitly run
both static engines from one build, both consume one host-owned resource set,
and the Livery pin presents the real-page fixture with linked CSS and
resources. R5 remains a named F4 prerequisite until every item is built or
accepted as a recorded knockout.
