# Buckram K4 completion lane

**Date:** 2026-08-08

**Status:** B0 through B8 have implementation receipts. B8's command-model
evidence is accepted; its headed image, device-scale, writing-mode, and WPT
matrix remains unmeasured. B9 is not started. The lane closes K4 and stops
before K5 implementation.

**Architectural authority:** [Buckram CSS layout engine
plan](2026-07-26_buckram_css_layout_engine_plan.md)

**Table authority:** [Buckram K4 CSS tables execution
plan](2026-07-28_buckram_k4_css_tables_execution_plan.md)

**Collapsed-border detail:** [Buckram K4g collapsed-border execution
plan](2026-07-28_buckram_k4g_collapsed_border_execution_plan.md)

**Color dependency:** [Livery contextual color computation
plan](2026-07-28_livery_contextual_color_computation_plan.md)

## Charge

Take the accepted K4g1 tree through one standards-owned unfragmented table
path, delete the remaining table-to-Grid and row-to-Flex compatibility path,
append the K4 closure receipt, and stop.

This is a serial implementation lane for one agent. It includes the Livery
color gates that directly block collapsed-border integration. It does not
include general positioning, persistent relayout, fragmentation, Pelt engine
selection, HTML presentational hints, or Stylo retirement.

The lane exists because the parent plans contain three kinds of unfinished
work that were previously interleaved:

1. K4g1 supplied collapsed-border topology but not conflict resolution,
   metrics, sizing integration, paint, or mutation handling.
2. K4d's planned bridge-deletion receipt did not land. Live
   `place_table_cell`, `table_is_flattenable`, table-to-Grid, and row-to-Flex
   paths remain because later K4 deferrals can still select them.
3. K4d through K4f receipts name table-model and separated-paint work that has
   no executable handoff: row-group height, inline-table baseline use,
   vertical-flow captions, collapsed-track cell clipping, layered table
   backgrounds, DOM-order cell paint, `empty-cells`, and border-spacing paint.

K4 is not closed by running K4g2 through K4g6 alone. This lane schedules those
stranded items before the final bridge deletion.

## Accepted base

- K0 through K3 are accepted.
- K4a through K4e have accepted capability receipts, with the residuals named
  below still open.
- K4f's collapsed-track capability is accepted at `bad53b5cb2f`; the rest of
  K4f's separated-paint outcome is open.
- K4g1 is accepted at `19b91b6ebef`.
- Contextual-color C0 is accepted; C1 is the first gate in this lane.
- K5, K6, and K7 have not begun implementation.

At B0 entry, record the current branch and `git rev-parse HEAD`. Do not reset
the worktree to an accepted commit. Existing unrelated changes belong to the
current checkout and must be preserved.

## Ownership

Buckram owns:

- table topology, sizing, row layout, fragments, border conflict resolution,
  border metrics, and logical border geometry;
- one standards-shaped table result under both separated and collapsed border
  models; and
- explicit deferrals whose later owner is named.

Livery and `genet-livery` own:

- computed color representation and used-color resolution;
- translation from computed physical sides into Buckram logical inputs;
- retained-document invalidation; and
- lowering accepted Buckram fragments and paint geometry to neutral paint
  commands.

The neutral paint API owns reusable path, stroke, and border primitives. It
does not own CSS table conflict rules.

Taffy may still format flex or grid content inside a table cell. It may not
represent the table, a table row, or table track selection after B10.

## Lane order

| Gate | Outcome |
|---|---|
| B0 | Livery C1 supplies one authoritative computed color value |
| B1 | K4g2 selects one collapsed-border winner per atomic segment |
| B2 | K4g3 selects spanning-side behavior and projects layout metrics |
| B3 | stranded table sizing and wrapper geometry are closed |
| B4 | K4g4 reruns K4c/K4d with collapsed metrics |
| B5 | the unfinished K4f separated table paint model is completed |
| B6 | Livery C2 supplies explicit scheme and system-color context |
| B7 | Livery C3 moves every color consumer to used-value resolution |
| B8 | K4g5 emits final collapsed-border geometry and paint |
| B9 | K4g6 handles mutation and removes collapsed-border fallbacks |
| B10 | K4h deletes the table bridge, audits deferrals, and closes K4 |

Accepted implementation gates land in this order. A gate gets its own receipt
and commit. Research artifacts may be prepared ahead, but later behavior does
not land early.

## B0. One authoritative computed color

Execute C1 exactly as specified by the contextual-color plan.

Primary seams:

- `components/livery/src/values/color/`;
- `components/livery/src/values/property.rs`;
- `components/livery/src/cascade.rs`; and
- `components/livery/build.rs`.

The accepted result preserves contextual expressions through declaration
parsing, `var()`, CSS-wide keywords, inheritance, generated field copies,
gradients, shadows, and decoration values. It does not yet choose a system
palette or lower colors to paint.

**Receipt:** entered `main` at
`4c3c304206900e42ea877936a7f901e1f447ed96`. C1 now stores one non-`Copy`
`ComputedColor` through generated color longhands, gradients, shadows, and
text-decoration aliases; parser and computed-value construction perform no
palette lookup. Focused C1 and full Livery receipts pass, as do all
`genet-livery` targets. The committed contextual-color plan carries exact
counts and the remaining C2/C3 boundary.

**Stop after B0.** Run the C1 receipt, stage only the color-model paths, and
commit. Do not combine the color representation change with table adapter
work.

## B1. Atomic conflict winner

Execute K4g2 from the collapsed-border plan.

Primary seams:

- `components/buckram/src/table/borders.rs`;
- `components/buckram/src/table.rs` and `components/buckram/src/lib.rs` for
  public table contracts;
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_sizing.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_block.rs`; and
- the computed-side adapter in `components/genet-livery/src/style.rs` or one
  table-specific adapter module proved by the implementation.

Map physical computed sides into the table's logical axes once. Fill the
direction-corrected `TableBorderOrderKey`, then resolve CSS2 precedence with
one pure comparator. Preserve the winning computed color expression as data;
color does not participate in the ranking.

**Receipt:** pairwise, permutation, LTR/RTL, anonymous-source, `hidden`, and
all-`none` fixtures prove a total deterministic comparator. A source audit
finds one winner selector.

**2026-08-08 receipt:** B1's source landed in shared checkpoint
`9b596b7709d` before verification, then received a narrow gate correction and
receipt. Buckram retains one logical winner grid carrying `ComputedColor`,
with exact candidate ledgers and no duplicate winner for identical inputs.
Livery maps physical sides once through `FlowAxes` and reverses only the RTL
logical-inline tiebreak. The grid is retained on `PendingTable`; K4g3 metric
deferrals still prevent it from changing sizing, fragments, or paint. Buckram
(178), Livery (170 passed, 5 existing C2/C3 deferrals), and all
`genet-livery` targets pass; strict Clippy passes for Buckram and
`genet-livery`. The combined strict command is blocked by 146 unchanged Livery
diagnostics. The release WPT build passed as a compile receipt only; B1 does
not move collapsed-table geometry or paint.

## B2. Spanning-side rule and collapsed metrics

Execute K4g3. Use the recorded Chrome/Firefox matrix as prior research, then
recheck the exact cases that select the accepted rule. Do not repeat a broad
browser survey unless a focused recheck disagrees with the recorded evidence.

Keep atomic winners even if the accepted interop rule harmonizes a connected
side. Project explicit inline, block, outer-edge, and overflow metrics from
those winners. CSS-pixel half widths remain unsnapped.

**Receipt:** every metric traces back to exact atomic winners. The receipt
records the selected spanning-side rule and any stable split retained as a
named interoperability deferral.

**2026-08-08 receipt:** B2 retains each atomic winner per logical cell side
and projects only the scalar maximum half width, unsnapped, as
`MaximumHalfPerCellSide`. Chrome 151.0.0.0 selected that rule in all 18
focused spanning-side cases; Firefox 153.0 selected its order-dependent
recurrence in all 18, retained as the explicit
`FirefoxOrderDependentSpanningSide` deferral. The metrics carry exact winner
provenance, distinguish zero-width `hidden` suppression from all-`none`, and
separate outer-edge from overflow projections. Livery stores them beside the
winner grid and proves lowering while the one K4g4 sizing deferral remains;
there is no B2 sizing, fragment, or paint claim. Buckram (183), Livery (170
passed, 5 existing C2/C3 deferrals), and all `genet-livery` targets (197)
pass; both strict Clippy commands pass. The release WPT build passed in 3m02
as a compile receipt only.

## B3. Stranded table geometry

Close the model work named by accepted K4d and K4e receipts before rerunning
the table algorithms under collapsed metrics.

Primary seams:

- `components/buckram/src/table/rows.rs`;
- `components/buckram/src/table/pipeline.rs`;
- `components/buckram/src/table/fragments.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_block.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_wrapper.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/layout.rs`; and
- `components/genet-livery/src/text.rs`.

Work:

1. Carry row-group block-size constraints into `TableBlockSizingInput` and
   apply a definite row-group height over that group's rows using the accepted
   K4d interop rule.
2. Make an inline-table atom consume K4d5's exported first table baseline
   rather than the bottom of its margin box.
3. Place captions through the table's logical block axis. Vertical writing
   mode is table-wrapper work, not fragmentation work. The K4e3 receipt routed
   vertical-flow captions to K6; this lane corrects that routing.
4. Refresh the 2026-08-03 deferral census and classify every surviving
   counter from live counts, including `CaptionMinPendingK4e`,
   `PercentagePaddingPendingBasis`, and whatever remains of
   `GridSizeMismatch`, `InvalidConstraint`, and `FixedLayoutWithoutColumns`
   after the empty-table fix. A reachable case must gain a standards-owned
   input or an exact later owner. It may not select the table bridge merely
   because a basis is indefinite.
5. Preserve `getClientRects()` as a general multi-fragment API gap. Do not
   invent that API inside K4.

Split B3 into separate commits if row sizing and inline wrapper integration
touch independent acceptance surfaces. The lane order remains B3 before B4.

**Receipt:** row-group, vertical-flow caption, inline-table baseline, and
deferral-census fixtures pass on the Buckram table route. The receipt names
every surviving non-K4 owner.

### B3a. Row-group block constraints - 2026-08-08

`TableBlockSizingInput` now carries row-group constraints in K4b visual-group
order, and Livery lowers each generated row-group's `height` explicitly. A
definite group height is a minimum distributed only through that group's rows
by the accepted K4d3 table-height rule. Empty input means all groups are
`auto`; any non-empty input must match K4b group order exactly. The pure T4
fixture yields 66.67px and 133.33px from 20px and 40px minima under a 200px
group, and the live table-block route paints the same split.

The focused interop recheck remains aligned: Chrome 151.0.0.0 dumps T4 as
66.66px and 133.34px at 200px; Firefox 153.0's headless screenshot shows
66.67px and 133.33px at 200px. The generated recheck stays outside Git at
`target-buckram-b3/row-group-interop-recheck`. This subreceipt does not claim
the separate inline-table baseline, vertical-caption, or census parts of B3.

### B3b. Inline-table first baseline - 2026-08-08

`commit_table_block` now preserves K4d5's first and last baseline set on the
table algorithm node. The atomic-inline pass reads the first value before its
post-layout verification consumes the pending table, translates it from the
grid's block-start to the wrapper's margin-box block-start, and gives it to the
inline atom. That translation uses the painted grid origin, so a caption above
the grid cannot accidentally become part of the table baseline.

The text path applies that value only to baseline-family `vertical-align`
values. Other atomic boxes retain their prior block-end fallback and top,
middle, and bottom alignment retain their existing line-topology rules. The
live fixture gives the first and second rows 40px and 60px: the first row's
baseline agrees with its inline text peer, rejecting the former 100px wrapper
block-end substitution. This subreceipt leaves B3 vertical captions and the
deferral census open.

### B3c. Vertical-flow caption placement - 2026-08-08

The wrapper now chooses its backend main axis from its own logical block axis:
top-to-bottom remains ordinary block flow; vertical-rl uses right-to-left row
flow; vertical-lr uses left-to-right row flow. The wrapper is the only new
flex consumer. The grid remains its separate table child and retains ownership
of tracks and cell geometry.

The live fixture proves top and bottom captions on both `vertical-rl` and
`vertical-lr`: each lands at the wrapper's logical block-start or block-end,
rather than above or below the grid in physical y. This corrects the K4e3
route to K6. It does not claim vertical table-track layout or fragmentation;
those remain separate table-core and K6 work. The B3 census is still open.

### B3d. Live dispatch census and baseline closure - 2026-08-08

`LiveryDocument` now exposes the completed frame's table-shadow ledger and
`genet-wpt reftest --renderer livery --write-table-ledger <path>` writes its
per-rendered-document counters. The WPT runner retains a ledger for both the
test and reference, so a reftest cannot hide a table route exercised only by
its reference. The proof is generated outside Git at
`testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-08-08_buckram_b3`.

The census covers all 784 rendered documents in `css/css-tables` and
`css/CSS2/tables`. Buckram assigned 524 inline tables, verified 476, and
honored all 476; it laid out 524 block axes, verified 477, and agreed with all
477. There are no inline or block divergences. The remaining outcomes are
explicit:

| outcome | live count | disposition |
|---|---:|---|
| `CollapsedBorderMetricsPendingK4g` | 215 | B4 consumes the already-recorded metrics. |
| `PercentagePaddingPendingBasis` | 3 | CSS table used-size phase must supply the definite table-width basis after intrinsic measure, never a bridge-selected zero. |
| `FixedLayoutWithoutColumns` | 1 | Existing K4c input-validation error, not a named deferral. |
| `InvalidConstraint` | 1 | Existing K4c lowering error, not a named deferral. |
| `CaptionMinPendingK4e` | 0 | Closed by K4e's measured-caption path. |
| `TrackVisibilityPendingK4f` | 0 | Closed as a live sizing blocker; B5 retains its paint/clipping work. |
| `GridSizeMismatch` | 0 | Closed by the K4c empty-table repair. |

The last two errors stay visible as errors rather than being relabelled as
support. They are not B3 blockers or later-gate deferrals: K4c owns their
invalid input/lowering boundary. `getClientRects()` remains the general
multi-fragment API gap assigned to K6; B3 does not manufacture a table-only
DOM API.

The WPT run found two real baseline regressions before this receipt closed.
First, B3b's post-placement baseline correction affected ordinary
baseline-aligned atomic boxes. It now applies only when an inline table has
actually exported K4d5's first baseline. Second, direct rows and anonymous
row groups are topology groups, not authored `tbody`/`thead`/`tfoot` boxes;
their height must remain `auto` rather than reusing an owner height as a
second group constraint. `caption-side-applies-to-007.xht` and
`containing-block-029.xht` both render at a zero-pixel diff after those
corrections. The focused Livery receipts cover the text-peer baseline,
table-only baseline, vertical caption axis, explicit row-group distribution,
and an auto group that does not repeat the table height.

The refreshed maps are `62/68/198` for `css/css-tables`, `142/120/877` for
`css/CSS2/tables`, and `242/871/255` for `css/css-writing-modes`
(pass/fail/skip, zero errors). `css/css-tables` is unchanged from K4f.
`css/CSS2/tables` has twelve `needs-script` to `pass` changes from the WPT
runner's post-K4f classification update, not table geometry. The final
cross-lane comparison is against the B2 source under the main `Cargo.lock`;
every one of its nine map scopes remained at `unexpected=0`.

## B4. Collapsed sizing and overflow

Execute K4g4. Feed B2 metrics into the accepted K4c and K4d algorithms. Do
not fork fixed sizing, automatic sizing, or row layout for collapsed mode.

Primary seams:

- `components/buckram/src/table/{fixed,automatic,automatic_used,rows,sizing,pipeline,fragments}.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_sizing.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_block.rs`; and
- `components/genet-livery/src/table_shadow.rs`.

**Receipt:** sums reconcile content, padding, interior winners, half outer
winners, table size, and overflow. K4c/K4d fixtures rerun under both border
models. Accepted collapsed cases no longer produce either K4g metric
deferral.

### B4a. One sizing path and propagated outer spill - 2026-08-08

`TableInlineBorderMetrics::Collapsed` and `TableBlockBorderMetrics::Collapsed`
now carry the B2 projection through the existing fixed, automatic, and row
algorithms. A collapsed table contributes its own padding, one half of each
accepted outer winner, and no border spacing. Each cell replaces its declared
border offsets with B2's projected half-winner offsets, so an interior winner
is counted once across its two adjoining cells. No fixed, automatic, or row
algorithm forks by border model.

The emitted grid fragment retains the outer half-winner as logical overflow.
When Livery commits it, that overflow is unioned into the grid fragment and
its structural ancestors. The live 5px-border fixture observes a 2.5px spill
at both inline-start and block-start; it is a fragment-tree fact rather than
a paint-only rectangle.

The refreshed table census covers the same 784 rendered documents as B3:

| scope | inline assigned / verified / honored | block laid out / verified / agreed | collapsed metric deferrals |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `css/css-tables` | 293 / 276 / 276 | 293 / 279 / 279 | 0 of 127 projected tables |
| `css/CSS2/tables` | 440 / 399 / 399 | 440 / 400 / 400 | 0 of 88 projected tables |

There are no inline or block divergences. The six newly visible
`AutomaticIndefinite::ContainingInlineSize` outcomes in `css/css-tables`
are no longer concealed by a collapsed-metric deferral: they remain K4c's
named absent-containing-basis result. Three percentage-padding deferrals and
the two existing invalid inputs retain their B3 dispositions. The K4g metric
deferral count is zero in both scopes.

The reftest maps are now `64/66/198` for `css/css-tables` and `162/100/877`
for `css/CSS2/tables` (pass/fail/skip, zero errors): improvements of two and
twenty passes respectively over B3. The pure receipt has 188 Buckram tests,
covering fixed, automatic, and row sizing under collapsed metrics; the live
adapter suite covers the projected-metric dispatch and outer-spill fragment
propagation.

## B5. Separated table paint closure

Complete the unfinished portion of K4f before K4g5 relies on the table paint
phase.

Primary seams:

- `components/buckram/src/table/fragments.rs` for paint-relevant table
  structure only;
- `components/genet-livery/src/paint.rs`;
- `components/genet-livery/src/layout.rs`; and
- `components/genet-livery/tests/paint.rs` plus focused interaction/image
  fixtures.

Work:

1. Paint table, column-group, column, row-group, row, and cell background
   layers from their own fragments in table paint order.
2. Paint cells in DOM order even when spans change grid position.
3. Implement `empty-cells: show | hide` from actual cell content state.
4. Paint border-spacing gaps without adding spacing to geometry a second
   time.
5. Clip a cell spanning a collapsed track at the accepted track edge, then
   remove the adapter rule that keeps every spanned track visible.
6. Account for table background clipping, box shadow, and overflow at the
   wrapper/grid boundary.

B5 lands before the B6/B7 color gates. Its command and image fixtures use
plain authored colors so the later color migration cannot invalidate them;
scheme-dependent and system colors are not B5 evidence.

**Receipt:** command and image fixtures distinguish every background layer,
DOM order, empty cells, spacing, and collapsed-track clipping. Generic block
paint assumptions no longer decide table-internal paint order.

### B5a receipt (2026-08-08)

`TablePaintPlane` retains Buckram's emitted table subtree through both normal
and inline-atomic layout. Separated tables now paint table, column-group,
column, row-group, row, and cell backgrounds by that model's phase order;
cells use the model's DOM order, not their resolved grid coordinates. The
ordinary walk reuses emitted cell fragments, so an empty cell has a paint box
without registering a second geometry box.

`empty-cells: hide` now suppresses an actually blank separated cell's own
background and border. `visibility: collapse` no longer restores every span's
tracks: a cell crossing a collapsed row or column receives a descendant clip
at its accepted post-collapse fragment edge. Table shadow remains on the grid;
overflow stays on the caption-containing wrapper. This gate paints only plain
authored colors and leaves collapsed-border color selection to B6/B7.

Command receipts:

- `cargo test -p genet-livery --lib --offline -j 1`: 78 passed;
- `cargo test -p genet-livery --test paint --offline -j 1`: 62 passed,
  including focused B5 phase, DOM-order, empty-cell, spacing, collapsed-span,
  wrapper/grid, and atomic-inline receipts;
- current-source `genet-wpt --release` build completed; and
- generated non-Git image pairs under
  `C:\Users\mark_\Code\testing\genet\buckram-b5-wpt`, run with
  `--walk-discovery --renderer livery`, each passed 1/1:
  `b5-empty-cells-hide.html`, `b5-border-spacing.html`, and
  `b5-collapsed-colspan-clip.html`.

The canonical `css/css-tables/border-collapse-empty-cell.html` image pair also
passes 1/1 on the current renderer. By contrast,
`visibility-collapse-colspan-003.html` remains a localized visual failure;
that larger WPT case is recorded as follow-on conformance work, not claimed as
B5 proof. Its failure does not erase the passing generated clip pair, whose
two documents directly prove the B5 edge and image result.

## B6. Computed color context

Execute contextual-color C2 as a separate gate. Add element `color-scheme`,
host preference, used scheme, and a host-owned system palette. Resolve system
colors at computed-value time under the correct element scheme.

**Stop after B6.** Scheme/palette computation and downstream paint migration
remain separately attributable.

### B6a receipt (2026-08-08)

Contextual-color C2 is complete as a separate color-model gate.
`color-scheme` now carries the element's supported scheme order and `only`
flag, while `Device` separately owns the media preference and configurable
light/dark `SystemPalette`. The computed cascade selects the element's used
scheme before resolving foreground `color` and system-color leaves.

The direct receipt uses distinct injected light and dark palette values: a
direct child system color follows `color-scheme: only dark`, whereas an
inherited system color remains its light parent's already-absolute result.
The retained-style receipt proves the same result reaches `StylePlane` while
the host preference remains light. Gradients, shadows, borders, backgrounds,
and foreground fields carry no direct system leaf after computation.

C3 was deliberately left to the separate B7 receipt below; this B6 receipt
does not claim its CSSOM, palette invalidation, animation, or headed
color-output work.

Verification: `livery` contextual-color passed 4 active / 4 intentionally
ignored C3 receipts; the full `livery` wall and all `genet-livery` targets
passed with no failures, including style-context, invalidation, and paint.

## B7. Color observables and consumers

Execute contextual-color C3. CSSOM, backgrounds, borders, decoration,
gradients, shadows, text, and animation must resolve the authoritative
computed color through an explicit used-value context. Remove the black
fallback for a valid unresolved expression.

**Receipt:** CSSOM and headed paint agree after inheritance, scheme changes,
palette changes, and one animation sample. K4g may now accept headed color
evidence.

### B7a receipt (2026-08-08)

C3 is complete as a separate used-color consumer gate. `StylePlane` retains
the actual compute context and lowers a cloned view per element for CSSOM and
paint. Backgrounds, gradient stops, borders, shadows, and text now reach
paint as numeric colors; a valid color that misses this lowering is an
invariant failure, not a black compatibility fallback. Generated
`text-decoration-color` is used-resolved for CSSOM. The current paint list has
no separate decoration primitive.

Checked preferred-scheme and system-palette setters invalidate retained style,
layout, and paint only when the value changes. Transition and keyframe
endpoints are lowered with their own element contexts before numerical
interpolation. The focused receipt proves inherited `currentcolor` CSSOM and
paint consumers, contrast color, system-color direct versus inheritance,
preference and palette mutation, and a midpoint contextual transition.

Verification: `livery` contextual color passed 4 active tests with 4
explicitly ignored cascade-only C3 receipts; the full `livery` wall passed;
`genet-livery` contextual consumers passed 6 tests; and all
`genet-livery` targets passed with no failures. The named selected WPT gates
remain unmeasured. B7 is a retained-style and headed-paint receipt, not a
WPT-conformance claim.

## B8. Collapsed-border geometry and paint

Execute K4g5. Derive segment endpoints from B4's final grid lines, retain
logical geometry until the final flow transform, and emit each winner once in
the table phase established by B5.

Primary seams:

- `components/buckram/src/table/borders.rs` plus a dedicated geometry module
  if the model warrants one;
- `components/genet-livery/src/paint.rs`;
- neutral paint command types only if existing path, stroke, and border
  primitives cannot express the accepted joins; and
- command/image fixtures at device scales 1 and 2.

A neutral paint API change is its own provider commit with renderer receipts.
The Genet consumer commit follows it.

**Receipt:** suppressed segments are absent, each winner is emitted once,
every accepted style is represented, and generic per-cell border commands are
suppressed in collapsed mode.

### B8a implementation receipt (2026-08-08)

`TableGridLines` derives logical row and column lines from K4g4's final
`TableFragments`. Buckram lowers the already-resolved atomic winner grid once,
keeps CSS-pixel widths and centered strips unsnapped, retains the winning
`BoxId`, maps collapsed `inset` to `ridge` and `outset` to `groove`, and emits
in deterministic `TableGridEdge` order. `hidden` and all-`none` answers are
omitted before a paint consumer sees them.

Livery carries this geometry in the K4f table paint model. It paints the grid
background with the structural background phase, resolves the stored winning
color against that winner's C3 used-color context, converts logical geometry
through the final grid fragment's `FlowAxes` once, and retains that exact
`FragmentId` with the winner in its internal final paint segment. Generic table
and cell `DrawBorder` emission is suppressed in collapsed mode. Existing
neutral `DrawRect` and `DrawStroke` commands suffice: solid, double, ridge,
and groove lower to CSS-pixel fills; dashed lowers to a dashed butt-capped
stroke and dotted to a round-capped dotted stroke. No `paint_list_api` or
renderer provider change was made.

Command receipts pass:

- `cargo test -p buckram --lib --offline -j 1`: 190 passed, including exact
  logical strip coordinates, relief-style mapping, deterministic winner order,
  and hidden-winner omission;
- `cargo test -p genet-livery --lib collapsed_border --offline -j 1`: 4
  passed, including a real 2×2 collapsed table with 12 atomic winners, winner
  `currentcolor`, generic-border suppression, and a hidden edge that emits no
  replacement; and
- the complete built `genet-livery` library test binary: 81 passed.

This is a command-model receipt, not a conformance claim. Images at device
scales 1 and 2, LTR/RTL and vertical/sideways writing-mode captures, the
multi-way join allocation scan, and the named collapsed-border WPT selection
remain unmeasured. Do not begin B9 until that evidence is either attached or
explicitly re-scoped.

## B9. Dynamic collapsed-border closure

Execute K4g6. Recompute candidates, winners, metrics, geometry, and paint when
participating styles, roles, spans, track visibility, structure, direction,
or writing mode change. A color-only change preserves geometry; a winning
width change reruns K4c and K4d.

Delete collapsed-as-separated sizing and paint paths, duplicate winner logic,
and accepted K4g deferral variants. Remove the `table-layout` partial marker
only after the collapsed K4c/K4d receipt passes.

**Receipt:** source and command audits find one candidate grid, one winner
selector, one metrics path, and one paint lowering. Mutation fixtures cannot
leave layout and paint on different winner generations.

## B10. K4h bridge deletion and closure

K4d planned to delete the compatibility bridge but its accepted live slice
retained it for later-K4 deferrals. B10 performs the deletion; it does not
merely audit an earlier removal.

Primary deletion seams:

- `components/genet-livery/src/layout.rs`:
  `place_table_cell`, `table_is_flattenable`, table bridge counters, and
  table/row backend style mutations;
- any table-to-Grid or row-to-Flex selection in `genet-livery` or Buckram's
  Taffy adapter; and
- obsolete table deferral variants, compatibility switches, and shadow
  comparisons whose acceptance purpose has ended.

Work:

1. Apply relative offsets to preserved table-part fragments and expose the
   correct wrapper/internal containing fragments for K5.
2. Inventory every table deferral and compatibility flag from source and live
   counters.
3. Route general absolute, fixed, and sticky behavior to K5 and
   fragmentation-dependent behavior to K6 while keeping each table on the
   Buckram dispatcher.
4. Route genuinely foundational sizing cycles to K7 without reviving table
   Grid/Flex dispatch.
5. Delete the compatibility bridge and prove flex/grid content inside cells
   remains the only table-adjacent Taffy use.
6. Append the exact K4 receipt to the parent and master plans.

**Stop after B10.** Do not begin K5 implementation in the same task.

## Verification ladder

Every behavior-changing gate runs the smallest owning tests first, then the
shared table surface:

```powershell
cargo test -p buckram --lib --offline
cargo test -p livery --offline
cargo test -p genet-livery --all-targets --offline
cargo clippy -p buckram -p livery -p genet-livery --no-deps --offline -- -D warnings
cargo build -p genet-wpt --release --all-features --offline
rustfmt --edition 2024 --check <touched Rust files>
git diff --check
```

If the combined strict Clippy command fails only on an untouched known
warning, prove that source byte-identical to the accepted base, run strict
Clippy on every touched package, and report the combined command as blocked.
Do not turn a partial strict run into a pass claim.

Use the gate-specific WPT families named in the K4g plan. At B3, B4, B5, B8,
B9, and B10, refresh complete `css/CSS2/tables`, `css/css-tables`, and
`css/css-writing-modes` maps; B3 belongs in that list because row-group
heights, captions, and inline-table baselines move live geometry. Run the all-nine comparison whenever shared
sizing, fragments, paint, or writing-mode behavior moves.

Generated maps, screenshots, and proof builds stay under a gate-specific
`testing/genet/wpt-ledger` directory outside Git. Each receipt distinguishes:

- pure Buckram model proof;
- Livery adapter proof;
- live unheaded behavior;
- headed paint behavior; and
- incumbent differential movement.

Only the first four can establish K4 capability. Incumbent movement is a
regression signal.

## Working-tree and commit discipline

- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Stage only the current gate's files.
- Record the accepted base and resulting commit in the gate receipt.
- Keep implementation, generated proof, and expectation-map changes
  attributable.
- Stop when a named gate passes. Begin the next gate in a fresh task or
  explicit continuation.

## Lane stop rules

- Stop if HTML attributes enter Buckram.
- Stop if conflict resolution happens during sizing or paint.
- Stop if collapsed mode forks K4c or K4d into a second sizing algorithm.
- Stop if K4f paint reconstructs group or column geometry from cells.
- Stop if a table deferral selects the old Grid/Flex table engine after B10.
- Stop if `genet-layout` becomes a source of CSS semantics.
- Stop if a K5, K6, K7, presentational-hint, Pelt-route, or Stylo-retirement
  concern is implemented without its owning gate.
- Stop if a WPT pass is credited to Buckram while the compatibility bridge
  supplied the result.

## Done condition

The lane is complete when:

1. separated and collapsed tables share one Buckram topology, sizing, row,
   fragment, and wrapper path;
2. collapsed borders have one candidate grid, one accepted winner rule, one
   metric projection, and one paint lowering;
3. K4d/K4e/K4f residuals named in this lane have receipts or an exact K5-K7
   owner that does not require table fallback;
4. live mutation keeps sizing and paint on the same border generation;
5. `place_table_cell`, `table_is_flattenable`, table-to-Grid, row-to-Flex,
   and table-specific Taffy style mutations are deleted;
6. every unfragmented table stays on Buckram even when a later positioning,
   fragmentation, or foundational sizing feature is unsupported; and
7. the master plan contains the accepted K4 receipt and names K5a as the next
   architecture gate.
