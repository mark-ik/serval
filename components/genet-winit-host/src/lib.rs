//! Shared genet-on-winit host plumbing.
//!
//! What is specific to winit lives here: the single-window [`SurfaceHost`]
//! convenience, wheel translation, and the AccessKit bridge. The present
//! mechanics under them — booting wgpu + a netrender [`Renderer`], configuring
//! a surface, rasterizing a [`Scene`], acquiring a backbuffer — are not about
//! windowing at all and now live in `genet-render-host`, which a browser
//! canvas host reaches without pulling winit or accesskit into its build.
//! [`RenderCore`] and [`WindowSurface`] are re-exported here so existing
//! callers are unaffected.
//!
//! Each host keeps its own scene composition and input routing. Cambium
//! keyboard translation lives in `cambium-winit`; this engine host does not
//! depend on the GUI layer.
//!
//! Per-frame shape a host follows:
//!
//! ```text
//! let (_tex, view) = host.rasterize(&scene, w, h, clear);   // one per layer
//! let Some(frame)  = host.acquire() else { return };         // skip if outdated
//! let target = frame.texture.create_view(&Default::default());
//! host.renderer().compose_external_texture(&view, &target, host.format(), w, h, placement);
//! host.queue().present(frame);
//! ```
