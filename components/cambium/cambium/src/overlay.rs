//! Host overlays / popups: an absolutely-positioned layer placed by a point.
//!
//! An overlay is a `position: absolute` element placed by an inline `style`.
//! Livery/Buckram implements positioned stacking and z-index, so an
//! out-of-flow `position: absolute` box auto-lifts above in-flow content regardless
//! of document order; overlapping positioned boxes order by `(z-index, document
//! order)`. (No portal / teleport: an overlay stays a DOM child of wherever it is
//! placed — it is lifted in *paint* order, not reparented, so its position still
//! resolves against its containing block; see responsibility 1.)
//!
//! Two pieces, point-anchoring first:
//!   * [`overlay_at`] — the primitive: a positioned box at an `(x, y)` in the
//!     coordinate space of its nearest positioned ancestor.
//!   * [`anchor_point`] + [`Placement`] — the element-anchoring math: given a
//!     trigger element's laid-out box (which only the host knows, post-layout)
//!     and a [`Placement`], compute the `(x, y)` to hand to [`overlay_at`]. Pure
//!     and geometry-only (plain `f32`s, no engine types), so it stays in this
//!     headless crate; the host reads the trigger's fragment rect and calls it.
//!
//! ## Two responsibilities the caller owns
//!
//! 1. **A positioned ancestor.** `position: absolute` resolves against the
//!    nearest positioned ancestor (Genet/taffy has no true viewport-fixed
//!    box). Make the app root `position: relative` so an overlay's `(x, y)` is
//!    root-relative and predictable.
//! 2. **Stacking.** A `position: absolute` overlay auto-lifts above its in-flow
//!    siblings (Appendix E out-of-flow lift), so no special ordering is needed to
//!    sit over normal content. To order two overlapping overlays, give the one that
//!    should win a higher `z-index`, or rely on document order as the tie-break at
//!    equal `z` (the later sibling wins). The old "must be last sibling" rule is
//!    obsolete.
