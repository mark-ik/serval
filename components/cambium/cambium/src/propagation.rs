// Shared event-propagation state for the native dispatcher.
//
// The native dispatch path sends an event *by value* (a `Clone`) to each
// listener it routes to, so a handler cannot mutate one shared event struct the
// way the JS DOM dispatcher does (`event.stopPropagation()` flipping a field
// every later listener sees). To get the same semantics here, the cancellation
// flags live behind a shared `Rc<Cell<…>>`: cloning the event clones the
// *handle*, not the flags, so a handler that calls `stop_propagation()` /
// `prevent_default()` on the event it received is seen by the dispatch loop and
// by every other clone.
//
// This is the native twin of `dom.rs`'s `__stop` / `__stopImmediate` /
// `__canceled` on the JS `Event`. See
// `docs/history/2026-06-01_event_model_convergence_plan.md` — both dispatchers satisfy
// one propagation/cancellation contract.
