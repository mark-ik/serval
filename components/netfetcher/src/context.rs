//! [`FetchContext`] and the pluggable policy/storage **seams**.
//!
//! The context is caller-owned and shareable across requests; it holds the state
//! the Fetch algorithm threads through. Storage is behind traits so Mere can back
//! the cookie jar / HTTP cache with persona- or session-scoped partitions, and
//! CSP stays a *hook* the embedder supplies (policy lives in the host, not here).
//!
//! **Resolved (increment 1, plan OQ#4):** the seams take `&self` and use interior
//! mutability, so a single shared `&FetchContext` can both *read* (attach cookies)
//! and *record* (store `Set-Cookie`) during a fetch — and they are `Send + Sync`
//! so the fetch future is movable across a multi-thread runtime.
