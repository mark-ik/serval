//! Parley-backed text measurement for Taffy's measure_function hook.
//!
//! Provides [`TextMeasureCtx`] (parley's `FontContext` + `LayoutContext`,
//! created once per layout pass and threaded through every measure call) and
//! [`InlineContent`] (a Taffy leaf's inline content: styled [`InlineRun`]s plus
//! replaced inline boxes such as `<img>`).
//!
//! [`measure_inline_content`] builds a parley `Layout` from the runs + boxes,
//! breaks lines against the available width, and returns the measured
//! `(width, height)` for Taffy to use as the leaf's natural size. The same
//! `Layout` is cached for paint emission (positioned glyph runs + per-run brush
//! color), so measurement and paint agree.
//!
//! Each [`InlineRun`] carries the cascaded text style (`font-size`,
//! `font-family`, `font-weight`, italic, `color`, `text-decoration`
//! underline / line-through, `line-height`); `construct::gather_inline_content`
//! reads it per styling element. Overline and decoration color / style are not
//! yet plumbed.
//!
//! Cf. `docs/2026-05-17_genet_layout_planes_architecture.md`.
