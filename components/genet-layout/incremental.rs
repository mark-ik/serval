//! Stateful incremental layout session — the live wiring of fine-grained
//! restyle into the layout loop.
//!
//! [`IncrementalLayout`] persists the `StylePlane` (cascaded
//! `ElementData`) and `FragmentPlane` across mutations, so it can drive
//! Stylo's *incremental* restyle ([`restyle_with_snapshots`]) instead of
//! re-cascading from scratch — and then **skip layout entirely** when the
//! restyle's `RestyleDamage` is paint-only (e.g. a `color` swap).
//!
//! This is what the scripted tier's relayout-on-mutation routes through:
//! an attribute-only mutation batch restyles incrementally and re-lays-out
//! only if box geometry changed; a structural batch (insert / remove /
//! `innerHTML`) falls back to a correct full cascade + layout (those go
//! through the relayout-scope path, not the attribute/state invalidator).
//!
//! Cf. `docs/2026-05-25_fine_grained_restyle_plan.md`.

    // ── Orrery transform-motion perf spike (mere flip plan P0 / genet-as-host §8) ──

    // path (layout skipped), not full_relayout, at orrery scale?

    // What these tests establish:
    //  • The relayout WORRY is unfounded — a transform value change is paint-tier

    //    box geometry untouched, at N up to 1000. Proven on the CLASS path, which
    //    genet's incremental restyle handles today.
    //  • FINDING (tripwire): the orrery's *intended* mechanism — mutate each node's
    //    inline `style="transform:…"` every frame — is NOT yet picked up by the
    //    incremental restyle. A `style`-attribute change registers no damage
    //    (snapshot.rs marks it `other_attributes_changed`, which only drives
    //    `[attr]`-SELECTOR invalidation; inline-style re-cascade needs a
    //    `RESTYLE_STYLE_ATTRIBUTE` hint genet doesn't emit on the incremental
    //    path — the full `run_cascade` does apply it, dfe8702). So the gate's core
    //    fear is retired, but the orrery's continuous inline-transform motion has
    //    two genet prerequisites recorded in the flip plan P0.
