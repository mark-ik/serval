//! Box tree — genet's own layout arena implementing Taffy's trait-impl
//! tree, fed by [`stylo_taffy::TaffyStyloStyle`] (zero-copy over
//! `ComputedValues`).
//!
//! This is the alternative to the owned-`Style` `TaffyTree` model in
//! [`crate::construct`] + [`crate::layout`]. Where `TaffyTree` stores a
//! built `taffy::Style` per node (hence `cv_to_taffy`), the box tree
//! stores the cascade's `Arc<ComputedValues>` per node and lets
//! `TaffyStyloStyle` read layout properties straight off it. Taffy's
//! algorithms stay in Taffy — we implement only the tree shape + style
//! access traits and call `compute_root_layout` / `round_layout`.
//!
//! Increment 1 (this file): the arena, the trait impls, and
//! [`layout_via_box_tree`] producing a [`FragmentPlane`]. The
//! `TaffyTree`-based [`crate::layout::layout`] stays as the diff-test
//! oracle until the box tree reaches parity and the swap lands.
//!
//! Cf. `docs/2026-05-25_box_tree_trait_impl_plan.md`.
