//! Inline-box hit-testing: resolve a point inside an inline-formatting leaf to the
//! innermost inline element under it.
//!
//! The block fragment plane ([`crate::fragment::FragmentPlane`]) holds one box per
//! block-level / replaced / IFC-establishing element. A `display:inline` element
//! (`<a>`, `<span>`, `<label>`, …) establishes no box — it flows transparently into
//! its block's anonymous line boxes as parley runs — so the block hit-walk
//! ([`crate::genet_lane::walk_for_hit`]) can only ever resolve the containing
//! block. This module recovers the inline element by descending into the leaf's
//! cached `parley::Layout`: the same geometry paint emits from
//! ([`crate::paint_emit`]), so hit and paint mirror.
//!
//! Standards model (CSSOM View `elementFromPoint`; CSS2.2 §9.4.2; Appendix E.2):
//! an inline element broken across N lines is N boxes distributed across line
//! boxes. Its hittable area is therefore the **set** of its per-line glyph-cluster
//! rects — each line-box tall (leading included), tested by **containment**, never a
//! single union bounding box (which would false-hit the inter-line gutter of a
//! wrapped anchor). Within a line the point is resolved to the **glyph cluster**
//! under it, not the run (see [`inline_source_at`]). The host then maps the resolved
//! element to a navigation by walking up for an `<a href>`, exactly as
//! `elementFromPoint`'s caller would.

/// The atomic twin of [`inline_source_at`]. An atomic inline reserves its own

/// containment against its parley-placed box rather than by a cluster descent:
/// it carries no glyph runs of its own in this layout (its content is a separate
/// sublayout) and contributes no byte range to the leaf's source map, so the
/// cluster path cannot see it at all. That is why an unstyled `<button>` used to
/// hit as its containing block — a probe could aim at the control and the click
/// would land on the page behind it.
///
/// `boxes` is the leaf's `InlineContent::boxes`, indexed by the positioned box's
/// `id`. `(x, y)` is content-box relative, the space parley places boxes in — the

/// [`crate::inline_fragment`] records, so hit, paint, and rect queries mirror.

///
/// `layout` is the leaf's cached parley layout; `sources` is its byte-range →
/// source-element index (document order, disjoint, in the same byte space as the
/// layout's concatenated run text). `(x, y)` is relative to the leaf's content-box
/// top-left, the space the layout positions runs in.
///
/// Resolution is at glyph-cluster granularity, not run granularity. parley splits
/// shaping runs on font / script / bidi boundaries but **not on colour** (colour is
/// a per-cluster `Brush`), and a glyph run's first byte is the start of its whole
/// shaping run — so attributing a point by the run's first byte hands the entire
/// run (a colour-only mid-paragraph `<a>` included) to whatever element owns the
/// run's start, leaving the link unhittable. Instead this delegates the
/// line → run → cluster descent to parley's own
/// [`Cluster::from_point_exact`](parley::Cluster::from_point_exact), which walks
/// clusters in **visual** order (RTL-correct, since it maps each on-screen position
/// back to its logical byte) and returns `None` for a point past the line's text —
/// the containment miss that keeps the block leaf. The cluster's own
/// `text_range().start` (its logical first byte) then maps to a source; a byte in no
/// source range (the block's own direct text) yields `None`.
///
/// Two guards wrap the delegation. `from_point_exact` resolves `y` through
/// `line_for_offset`, which **clamps** an out-of-range `y` to the nearest line; so a
/// click in the leaf's padding above/below the text would resolve to a line's
/// cluster. The resolved cluster's line band is re-checked against `y` (the
/// half-leading model) and a miss falls through to the block, where padding belongs.
/// And an **end-of-line trailing-whitespace** cluster is skipped: a soft/hard break
/// hangs its trailing space (CSS Text), which is not part of the inline box's hit
/// area, so a click there keeps the block leaf rather than the element that happens
/// to own the space byte.
