//! Quiescence: the report a surface makes of its pending work, and the default
//! policy for "settled".
//!
//! Every automation harness that polls-and-sleeps does so because it cannot ask
//! the engine what is still in flight. The engine can answer per source, and the
//! per-source signals already exist — this module adds no mechanism, only the
//! common vocabulary the host uses to join them:
//!
//! - loads: `LoadingState` (this crate) — terminal at `Done` / `Failed`
//! - script microtasks: `script-engine-api`'s `pump` (`Quiescent` / `Pending`)
//! - timers: the runtime's `next_timer_delay()`
//! - animation-frame callbacks: the runtime's `has_animation_frame_callbacks()`
//! - declared animations: layout's `has_active_animations()`
//!
//! Only the host sees all of these at once, so the host assembles a
//! [`PendingWork`] per surface; consumers (a test harness, a WebDriver adapter,
//! an agent's observation) read it instead of sleeping.
//!
//! ## Settling vs perpetual sources
//!
//! The default [`settled`](PendingWork::settled) policy counts only work that
//! *finishes by itself*: loads, microtasks, and dirty layout. The other sources
//! are reported but do not block, each for a stated reason:
//!
//! - **Timers.** A page with `setTimeout(fn, 30_000)` is not "busy" for those
//!   thirty seconds. WebDriver's own document-readiness never waits on timers,
//!   and a harness that did would turn every long-poll page into a hang.
//! - **Animation-frame callbacks.** A one-shot rAF (schedule a measurement)
//!   settles next frame, but a rAF *loop* — every game loop, every physics
//!   surface — re-requests forever, and the two are statically
//!   indistinguishable. Blocking on rAF turns "the orrery is breathing" into
//!   "the harness never returns".
//! - **Declared animations.** CSS transitions/animations run on the engine's
//!   clock and may be infinite (`animation-iteration-count: infinite`).
//!
//! For those, the tool is a condition-wait ("element exists", "attribute
//! equals"), not a broader settle. A caller with cause to block on the
//! perpetual sources opts in explicitly via [`fully_idle`](PendingWork::fully_idle)
//! and owns the hang risk it is accepting.
