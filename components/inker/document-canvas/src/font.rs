//! Font-registration seam between the host and document-canvas's layout.
//!
//! parley needs fonts during *layout* (to shape text into glyph IDs +
//! positions). The host implements [`FontResolver`] to register its font
//! collection with parley's `FontContext` via
//! [`crate::text::LayoutEnvironment::with_resolver`]; layout-time shaping
//! then sees those faces.
//!
//! ## No render-side resolution
//!
//! There is deliberately no render-side method. Each
//! [`GlyphRun`](crate::GlyphRun) records the
//! [`FontFaceId`](crate::FontFaceId) of the face parley *actually* shaped
//! it against, and the real bytes ride in the
//! [`FontTable`](crate::FontTable) sidecar (see [`crate::font_table`]).
//! The paint-list producer ships those exact bytes, so the glyph ids and
//! the face can't desync on fallback.
//!
//! (Earlier a `resolve_font_data` method re-resolved a
//! `(family, weight, style)` label at emit time and shipped *that* face's
//! bytes — the wrong-face-on-fallback bug. It is removed: the bytes now
//! come from parley's own shaping.)

/// Trait the host implements to provide fonts for layout (parley).
