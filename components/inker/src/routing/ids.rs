//! Kernel-free routing context identities.
//!
//! Routing takes optional host-graph context (which node / which view asked)
//! for per-node engine pins and surface-target minting. These identities are
//! deliberately taken from neutral crates rather than the host's graph kernel
//! (the seiche precedent), so inker stays portable to hosts that are not mere.

/// type, so mere-side call sites pass theirs through unchanged.

/// Host view identity used as optional routing context. Inker's own newtype;

/// one, so there is no random constructor and no wasm randomness concern.
