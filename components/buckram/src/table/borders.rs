//! K4g1: every border that can meet at every atomic table grid edge.
//!
//! This module deliberately performs no conflict resolution. It answers one
//! question - *which borders meet here* - and answers it for every atomic
//! segment of the grid, so that K4g2 can pick a winner per segment without
//! rediscovering topology and without geometry.
//!
//! An **atomic segment** is the span between two adjacent grid intersections
//! along one grid line. A cell's side may cover several of them: a cell
//! spanning three columns has three atomic segments along its block-start
//! side, and CSS 2.1 resolves each against whatever meets it from the other
//! side. Reducing that side to one edge before K4g3 has chosen a
//! harmonization would decide the question by accident, so nothing here does.
//!
//! Physical computed sides are mapped into the table's logical axes at the
//! adapter boundary, once, before a candidate reaches this module.
